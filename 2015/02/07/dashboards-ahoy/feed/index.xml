Maybe not all are relevant, but there are quite a few tips and interesting good practices. In his methodology, pie charts are not exactly the best way to express a view, but waterfalls definitely are.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great collection of dashboard inspirations on Pinterest. 

Also really agree with &quot;Dashboards are not collection of individual charts, but an ensemble. Components of a dashboard should not be thought individually but as pieces that fit with one another.&quot; 

Thanks for sharing!]]></description>
