<p>I was pleasantly surprised to see that Agnieszka &#8211; Russian Sphinx chose a subject similar to mine &#8211; real estate, but in Moscow. Here&#8217;s her entry:<br />

<p>Now she and I used a different approach to display our map and I didn&#8217;t really comment on how I made mine (let alone how she made hers)<br />
Here&#8217;s my map for the record:<br />

<div style="float:right; padding-right:8px;"><a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/public?ref=http://public.tableausoftware.com/views/contest2011/WMap" target="_blank">Powered by Tableau</a></div>
</div>
<p>To create my map, I used the default mapping function of Tableau, where you declare the geographic role of two of your measures &#8211; one as latitude, one as longitude &#8211; and you can plot marks on a map, that can be zoomed, panned etc.<br />
<a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/latitude.png"><img src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/latitude.png" alt="" title="latitude" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918" /></a><br />
If one of your dimensions is geographical in nature, like a country, US state, US county name or code, Tableau can calculate latitude and longitude so you don&#8217;t have to provide them. This also works for zip codes. So, if you have a valid US address, you can extract the zip code out of that (before you put your data in Tableau) and Tableau can represent this on a map quite accurately.<br />
In my case, I had tens of thousands of marks, which were available at a much finer level than the zip code (sometimes down to the appartment number) so I thought it would be a pity to aggregate them so. My data came with notions like neighborhood or block numbers, which is specific to the New York administration I suppose, but interesting in my context. That idea of block number sounded like the right level of aggregation for my data.<br />
The problem is, how do I get the latitude and longitude of each of the blocks?<br />
How I did this was to chose one address per block, and then geocode it with python and google maps. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;q=geocoding+python&#038;safe=active">Geocoding </a>is the process of converting addresses, well, in geographical coordinates and while doing it in Python does require coding it is trivial and there are many ready-made examples around which can be reused as is.<br />
then, in my data, I put the coordinates of each block for every record. So any building sale can be associated with a laritude and longitude, which is that of their block.<br />
In another view, I have a simpler map &#8211; by neighborhood. Neighborhoods are another proprietary notion, they are groups of blocks. So, I simply average the latitude and longitude of all the buildings in the neighborhood to position their mark.</p>
<p>While it can be desirable to let users interact with the map, in many cases it is not a safe option. Once you let your users unzoom and/or scrool away from the action, it is not obvious for them to get back.<br />
So Agnieszka has used another nifty technique, that of background images.<br />
Her map is really a static file imported with the background image function which is found in the data menu:<br />
<a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/background-image.png"><img src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/background-image.png" alt="" title="background image" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919" /></a><br />
Like this, the user can really specify what to use for a map, when does it start, where does it end. The map won&#8217;t move afterwards.<br />
However, by doing so one cannot use geographic coordinates to display marks. One has to obtain, outside of Tableau, the x and y coordinates of each mark on the screen. Then, those x and y coordinates can be made into measures, and assigned respectively to the column and row shelves of the viz. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll let you figure out which one is best for your next map project. Note that you can generate highly customizable map backgrounds with a service like <a href="http://www.cloudmade.com/">cloudmade</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>Here is my Tableau contest 2011 entry.<br />
The rules stipulated it had to be about business, real-estate or finance, so I chose real-estate. Since everyone loves New-York, and since the data for real-estate transaction is <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dof/html/property/property_val_sales.shtml">relatively easy to get</a>, that&#8217;s what I show. In order to be within Tableau Public 100,000 row limit, I chose to show only the residential transactions (apartment buildings or buildings converted to apartment buildings), larger than 100 square foot and sold at at least $1. </p>
<p>Before I started, I wanted to create a Tableau that would be legible as a static image.<br />
We tableau tribe have seen a lot of interactive dashboards with sophisticated action. Here, I wanted to cater to the discriminate analyst who gets their kicks from seeing patterns emerge with a glance to 90k datapoints. </p>
<p>What does it show for instance? well, while the bulk of transactions are at a price close to the average there are a large part which are done considerably below that, and comparatively, very few which are markedly over that.<br />
The marks which are aligned show either many transactions at the same price (there are distinct $1, $10 and $100 lines for instance) or sales of similar properties. There were a string of sales of identical apartments at 1335 6th Avenue, for instance.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible to switch the function of the Y-axis of the scatterplot, which can either represent square feet or sale price. The largest transaction on the period was around $4 billion, and the largest in terms of area was just above 10m square feet.<br />
It is also possible to explore through the lists on the right. By selecting &#8220;other types&#8221; of buildings for instance you can see which apartment buildings once were yeshivas or fire stations or (what?) &#8220;detention houses for wayward girls&#8221; (there&#8217;s one in upper east side).<br />
You can also switch to a <a href="http://public.tableausoftware.com/views/contest2011/WMap">map-based version of this dashboard</a>. Speaking of maps, a right-click on any mark can open a google maps window centered on that address for you.</p>
<p>So here goes, enjoy the viz and good luck to all contestants</p>
