</div>
<p>so what&#8217;s the story?<br />
I have been inspired to do this via the work on <a href="http://www.onformative.com/work/fragments-of-rgb/">onformative</a> which I discovered on <a href="http://butdoesitfloat.com/1420489/One-has-to-arrive-at-a-specific-temperature-at-which-the-objects">But does it float</a>.</p>
<p>I was struck by how the proximity of a red dot, a green dot and a blue dot was interpreted by our human eyes as a spot of another color. Then again, this is how <a href="http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/lcd5.htm">monitors</a> <a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/monitor7.htm">work</a>. If you look hard enough on your lcd screen you may see the sub-pixels.<br />
This is also why, in an image such as this one, the segments of the line appear unaligned, although logically this line is one pixel wide.<br />
<a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/unaligned.png"><img src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/unaligned.png" alt="" title="unaligned" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926" /></a><br />
Physically, the segments are <em>indeed</em> unaligned, as the each segment uses sub-pixels of a different color which don&#8217;t have the same horizontal position within one pixel. </p>
<p>However, I didn&#8217;t realize that this effect would work with patches of blue, green and red much bigger than a subpixel.<br />
I made the underlying dataset from a picture of my daughter Violette when she was 2. I converted the picture to a list of values of red, green and blue (thanks, processing) which were all associated to a x and y position on the screen and the name of their layer (so they could be turned on or off). These x and y positions were derived from the position of the pixel on the original image, but the red, blue and green dots are all shifted in one direction so they form a triangle.<br />
Then, I&#8217;ve added some extra layers as noise to obfuscate the image. </p>
<p>Here, the effect is voluntary. Then again, if you position lots of marks one next to the other, you could re-create it accidentally, and instead of seeing three distinct dots, your users would see just one and of a different color at that!</p>
