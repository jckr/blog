				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This last two weeks, three high-profile data-related services have been released: google&#8217;s public data, Wolfram|Alpha and data.gov.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;q=unemployment+rate+santa+clara&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=g1"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-137" title="google's public data" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/googlepublicdata-300x210.png" alt="google's public data" width="300" height="210" /></a><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-138" title="Wolfram|alpha" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/wolframalpha-275x300.png" alt="Wolfram|alpha" width="275" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://data.gov/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-136" title="data.gov screenshot" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/datagov-300x223.png" alt="data.gov screenshot" width="300" height="223" /></a>In the next couple of posts I&#8217;m going to review all three.</p>
<p>But before I&#8217;d like to go back to 2007, when Swivel.com and Many-eyes.com were released.</p>
<p>Those 2 services allow users to publish their own data visualizations, based on datasets uploaded by themselves or by others. At the OECD, we had used the services extensively, uploading hundreds of datasets and creating that many visualizations.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, my main gripe with both services was never the visualization proper, or the interface, or any of the services to the data publisher &#8211; which the developers knew to be highly perfectible. No, what bothered me was the navigation within the site and how all the datasets were organized. There wasn&#8217;t any way to group your datasets or visualizations, then to group these groupings. Sure, they had an author name attached to them, and later, a theme, so it was possible to see all datasets from a specific author, or about a specific theme. But at the end of the day, that was a very long list, so the top titles received all the exposure, and the others, none. And indeed, we realized that some of our data objects got all the traffic, while others, not necessarily less interesting, had none &#8211; they were simply not seen.</p>
<p>My reaction to swivel and many-eyes was to tell them, you are not going to be able to allow users to search for data sets on your site. It&#8217;s too difficult and it&#8217;s not your focus. Forget about being a community site or a portal, and instead, allow users to share what they make on your sites in the environments they like. Allow them to download images, embed applets, you name it, but the navigation will have to happen on their site, not on yours.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s see how this applies to these 3 new services.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left; "><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-130" title="data flow" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/data-problem2.png" alt="data flow" width="448" height="298" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">To solve any problem with data, there are 5 things you need to do in sequence. </p>
<ul>
<li>First, <strong>find </strong>the relevant data source.</li>
<li>Then, <strong>access </strong>it and get the numbers you need. </li>
<li>Then, <strong>process </strong>those numbers to make them answer your question. </li>
<li><strong>Present </strong>the results, for instance, as a data visualization, </li>
<li>and, optionally, <strong>share</strong> your analysis with your colleagues or the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to go into details here on how the last 4 steps are getting a lot of attention and dedicated tools. </p>
<p>That leaves us with finding data. </p>
<p>In many cases, finding data is a given: to work with data, you have to start from a dataset. And many researchers know for a given where the data they need are, so they only need to get them, not to find them. </p>
<p>And besides, since 2002, there&#8217;s a canned answer to every search-related question &#8211; google.</p>
<p>But the fact is, finding data <em>is </em>difficult, and, currently, google isn&#8217;t doing a great job to help. </p>
<p>Datasets are produced by subject-matter experts who describe them in their own language. If you have a loosely-defined question, its terms won&#8217;t match the scientific description of the dataset. And even if you find something, you can&#8217;t tell for sure if you found the most appropriate dataset, if it&#8217;s reliable, or find related objects &#8211; actions which are common when one is searching among objects of the same nature, like books or journal articles. </p>
<p>Publishers in those two activities adressed the problem by coming up with a standard metadata, with systems like <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/">MARC records</a> or <a href="http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a>. But that doesn&#8217;t work so well on data.</p>
<p>To address this issue, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">oecd</span> published a white paper: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/603233448430">We Need Publishing Standards for Datasets and Data Tables</a>. (I&#8217;m credited in the end, but didn&#8217;t do much).</p>
<p>Without structured metadata standards for datasets, it&#8217;s impossible to search data across several publishers with any degree of reliability. But what a huge step that would be if an agreement could be found.</p>
