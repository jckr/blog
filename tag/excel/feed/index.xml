				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the past couple of months, I have been busy maintaining a <a href="http://www.oecd.org/statistics/factblog">blog for OECD: Factblog</a>.</p>
<p>The idea is to illustrate topics on which we work by a chart which we&#8217;ll change regularly. So in order to do that, I&#8217;d have to be able to create charts of publishable quality.</p>
<h2>Excel screenshots: not a good option</h2>
<p>There are quite a few tools to create charts on the net. Despite this, the <em>de facto</em> standard is still a screenshot of Excel, a solution which is even used <a href="http://theappleblog.com/2009/12/18/iphone-and-ipod-touch-see-international-surge/">by the most reputable blogs.</a></p>
<p><div id="attachment_289" style="width: 605px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://theappleblog.com/2009/12/18/iphone-and-ipod-touch-see-international-surge/"><img class="size-full wp-image-289" title="excelinblog" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/excelinblog.png" alt="excelinblog" width="595" height="555" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This is taken from http://theappleblog.com/2009/12/18/iphone-and-ipod-touch-see-international-surge/</p></div></p>
<p><a href="http://theappleblog.com/2009/12/18/iphone-and-ipod-touch-see-international-surge/"></a>But alas, Excel is not fit for web publishing. First, you have to rely on Excel&#8217;s choice of colours and fonts, which won&#8217;t necessarily agree to those of your website. Second, you can&#8217;t control key characteristics of your output, such as its dimensions. And if your chart has to be resized, it will get pixelated. Clearly, there is a better way to do this.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_280" style="width: 671px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://theappleblog.com/2009/12/18/iphone-and-ipod-touch-see-international-surge/"><img class="size-full wp-image-280" title="pixellated" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/pixellated.png" alt="That's a detail of the chart on the link I showed above. The letters and the data bars are not as crisp as they could have been." width="661" height="387" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">That&#39;s a detail of the chart on the link I showed above. The letters and the data bars are not as crisp as they could have been.</p></div></p>
<h2>How about interactive charts?</h2>
<p>Then again, the most sensible way to present a chart on the web is by making it interactive. And there is no shortage of tools for that. But there are just as many issues.<br />
Some come from the content management system or blogging environment. Many CMS don&#8217;t allow you to use javascript and/or java and/or flash. So you&#8217;ll have to use a technology which is tolerated by your system.</p>
<p>Most javascript charting solutions rely on the &lt;CANVAS&gt; element.  Canvas is supported by most major browsers, with the exception of the Internet Explorer family. IE users still represent roughly 40% of the internet, but much more in the case of my OECD blog, so I can&#8217;t afford to use a non-IE friendly solution. There is at least one library which works well with IE, <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">RaphaelJS</a>.<br />
Using java cause two problems. First, the hiccup caused by the plug-in loading is enough to discourage some users. Second, it may not be understood well by readers:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_281" style="width: 574px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/java-reader.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-281" title="java reader" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/java-reader.png" alt="This is how one of my post reads in google reader. " width="564" height="323" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This is how one of my posts reads in google reader. </p></div></p>
<p>And it&#8217;s futile to believe that readers will read blogs from their home pages. So if all readers can&#8217;t show it well it&#8217;s a show-stopper.</p>
<h2>A tool to create good bitmap charts</h2>
<p>So, in a variety of situations the good old bitmap image is still the most appropriate thing to post. That&#8217;s why I created <a href="http://www.openprocessing.org/visuals/?visualID=6595">my own tools</a> with <a href="http://www.processing.org/">Processing</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/plotter-windows.zip">plotter windows</a></p>
<p><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/plotter-mac-OS-X.zip">plotter mac OS X</a></p>
<p><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/plotter-linux.zip">plotter linux</a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works.</p>
<p>when you unzip the files, you have a file called &#8220;mychart.txt&#8221; which is a set of parameters. Edit the file according to the instructions in &#8220;instructions.txt&#8221; to your liking, then launch the tool (plotter application). It will generate an image, called &#8220;mychart.png&#8221;.</p>
<p>The zip files contain the source code, which is also found here on <a href="http://www.openprocessing.org/visuals/?visualID=6595">my openprocessing account</a>.</p>
<p>With my tools, I wanted to address two things. First, I wanted to be able to create a chart and to have a precise control of all of its components, especially the size. In Excel, by contrast, it&#8217;s difficult to control the size of the plotting area, or the placement of the title &#8211; all of this things are done automatically and are difficult to correct (when it&#8217;s possible). Second, I wanted to be able to create functional thumbnails.</p>
<p>If you have to create smaller versions of a chart from a bigger image, the easiest solution is to resize the chart using an image editing software. But that&#8217;s what you&#8217;d get:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_282" style="width: 420px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/GDP-original.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-282 " title="GDP original" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/GDP-original.png" alt="That's the original chart." width="410" height="320" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">That&#39;s the original chart.</p></div></p>
<p><div id="attachment_283" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/GDP-resized.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-283 " title="GDP resized" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/GDP-resized.png" alt="And that's the resized version. Legible? nah." width="250" height="180" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">And that&#39;s the resized version. Legible? nah.</p></div></p>
<p>But what if it were just as easy to re-render the chart in a smaller size, than to resize it with an external program? My tool can do that, too.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_285" style="width: 580px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/GDP-small1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-285" title="GDP small" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/GDP-small1.png" alt="Left: resized, right: re-rendered." width="570" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Left: resized, right: re-rendered.</p></div></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a gallery of various charts done with the tool. The tool supports: line charts, bar charts (both stacked and clustered), dots charts and area charts. No pie charts included. It&#8217;s best suited for simple charts with few series and relatively few data points.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_286" style="width: 420px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/example-1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-286" title="example 1" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/example-1.png" alt="Impact of energy subsidies on CO2 emissions" width="410" height="320" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Impact of energy subsidies on CO2 emissions</p></div></p>
<p><div id="attachment_287" style="width: 420px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/example-2.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-287" title="example 2" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/example-2.png" alt="Temperature and emission forecasts" width="410" height="320" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Temperature and emission forecasts</p></div></p>
<p><div id="attachment_288" style="width: 420px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/example-3.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-288" title="example 3" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/example-3.png" alt="Greenhouse gas emission projections" width="410" height="320" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Greenhouse gas emission projections</p></div></p>
<p>I hope you find it useful, tell me if you do and let me know if you find bugs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are using computers for work, chances are that you are spending a good portion of your day with Microsoft products such as the Office suite. Some hate it, some love it, but to hundreds of millions it&#8217;s part of our daily lives and its design choices affect how we think and work in a much more profound way than we are aware of. So, the release of a new version of Office is always a significant event.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just installed Office 2010 and here are my first impressions.</p>
<h2>The UI is rationalized.</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_235" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/excel-2010.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-235" title="excel 2010" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/excel-2010.png" alt="excel 2010" width="600" height="552" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The UI is rationalized.</p></div></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>The interface will be familiar to Office 2007 users &#8211; they are <strong>still using the ribbon</strong>. Only a few buttons have been added to the applications I&#8217;ve tested, and the others have fortunately not moved since the previous version. However, the ribbon&#8217;s colours have been muted to a conservative white to grey gradient, which is <strong>much easier on the eyes</strong>. The added benefit is to make highlighted sections of the ribbon stand out much more efficiently.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_236" style="width: 808px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/excel-highlight.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-236" title="excel highlight" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/excel-highlight.png" alt="excel highlight" width="798" height="509" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Highlighting a section works much better against a sober gray than against a vivid blue.</p></div></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>The one button that changed was the<strong> top-left Office button</strong>. Frankly, what it was for was obvious to no-one in Office 2007. Due to its appearance, it wasn&#8217;t really clear that it was clickable, and the commands it gave access to were a mixed bunch &#8211; file control, program options, printing, document properties&#8230; which, before, were not in the same top-category.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_237" style="width: 646px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/office-backstage.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-237" title="office backstage" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/office-backstage.png" alt="This new area is called &quot;Office backstage&quot; and is a welcome change to the akward &quot;file&quot; menu or office button from previous versions." width="636" height="553" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This new area is called &quot;Office backstage&quot; and is a welcome change to the akward &quot;file&quot; menu or office button from previous versions.</p></div></p>
<p>In Office 2010, the Office button is still there, but this time, it looks like a button and is much more inviting. This time, it presents the user with the various commands on a separate screen. That way, commands are well-categorized, and there is ample space for UI designers to explain those commands which are not clear. This had not been possible when all those commands were forced to fit in one tiny menu.</p>
<p>Another thing that jumped at me when I started manipulating the programs were the <strong>improvement in the copy/paste interface</strong>. It&#8217;s fair to say that pasting has always been a very time-consuming task. It had never been easy, for instance, to paste values only or to keep source formatting, without having to open menus and choose options which require time and effort. Besides, some pasting options descriptions are cryptic and a bit daunting, so novice users aren&#8217;t encouraged to use them for fear of what might happen.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_238" style="width: 547px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/paste1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-238" title="paste1" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/paste1.png" alt="I've been using Excel for about 15 years so I know my way around. But improvement in the paste interface directly translates into productivity gains." width="537" height="491" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I&#39;ve been using Excel for about 15 years so I know my way around. But improvement in the paste interface directly translates into productivity gains.</p></div></p>
<p>Now the various pasting options are promoted within the contextual menu &#8211; they are big icons, and it is possible to preview how pasted material would look before pasting. The best part is that these commands are now accessible via native keyboard shortcuts, so we no longer need a string of 4 mouse clicks, or having to key in <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">alt+E, V, S,  enter</span> alt + H, V, S, V, enter in sequence. After a normal paste (ctrl +V) you can hold control and choose a one key option, such as V for values, T for transposing, etc. Much better.</p>
<h2>Changes in the Excel chart engine</h2>
<p>There are 3 ways in Excel to represent numbers graphically: charts proper, pivot charts and sparklines.</p>
<p><strong>Charts </strong>and pivot Charts<strong> didn&#8217;t see much improvement</strong> since the previous version of Excel. The formatting options move along in the direction initiated by Excel 2007: in addition to the controversed 3-D format set of options, users now have an advanced &#8220;shadow&#8221; and &#8220;glow and soft edges&#8221; submenus to spice up their charts. The interface for designing gradient fills has been upgraded. The underlying functionality remains unchanged but it is now easier to control. However, the pattern fill option returns, which is great news for people who print their graphs in B&amp;W.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_239" style="width: 533px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/shadow-and-soft-edges.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-239" title="shadow and soft edges" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/shadow-and-soft-edges.png" alt="Even more complex formatting options mean a greater chance to use them poorly" width="523" height="384" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Even more complex formatting options mean a greater chance to use them poorly</p></div></p>
<p><strong>Sparklines are the real innovation of Excel 2010</strong>. Sparklines are a minimalist genre of chart that has been designed to fit in the regular flow of the text &#8211; they don&#8217;t require more space to be legible and efficient. While sparklines do not allow a user to look up the value of a specific data point, they are very efficient for communicating a trend. As such, they are increasingly used in dashboards and reports. There has been 3rd-party solutions to implement them in Excel but this native implementation is robust and well done. This will put sparklines on the radar for the great number of people who didn&#8217;t use them because they were not aware of their existence.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_240" style="width: 603px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/sparklines.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-240" title="sparklines" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/sparklines.png" alt="Sparklines give immediate insight on the trends in this data table. A dot marks when the maximum value was reached. That makes it easier to compare peaks at a glance." width="593" height="627" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sparklines give immediate insight on the trends in this data table. A dot marks when the maximum value was reached. That makes it easier to compare peaks at a glance.</p></div></p>
<h2>Changes in other applications</h2>
<p><strong>Word </strong>has advanced options for opentype fonts, for instance, if your font has several character sets, you can now access them from Word. This is especially good for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjhDWAXlAII">distressed fonts</a> or the excessively ornate ones. In addition to kerning, it is now possible to control ligatures (i.e. to allow users to specify how ff, fl or fi would appear on screen, as one unique glyph or as two separated letters). Another new feature of Word is an advanced spell checker who is able to warn you of possible word choice errors, when using homonyms for instance.</p>
<p>On my setup, these 3 options didn&#8217;t really work, but it&#8217;s a beta and I understand the intent.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_241" style="width: 553px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/word-spelling-ko.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-241" title="word spelling ko" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/word-spelling-ko.png" alt="The advanced spell checker didn't catch those words which were quite obviously used out of context." width="543" height="550" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The advanced spell checker didn&#39;t catch those words which were quite obviously used out of context.</p></div></p>
<p><div id="attachment_242" style="width: 553px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/word-spelling-ok.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-242" title="word spelling ok" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/word-spelling-ok.png" alt="In French, it picked sides in a famous spelling controversy. Many people believe that Perrault originally wrote that Cindirella wore fur slippers (soulier de vair). Microsoft sides with Disney on that ones and glass slippers (souliers de verre)." width="543" height="550" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">In French, it picked sides in a famous spelling controversy. Many people believe that Perrault originally wrote that Cindirella wore fur slippers (soulier de vair). Microsoft sides with Disney on that one and glass slippers (souliers de verre).</p></div></p>
<p><strong>Powerpoint</strong> features 3 high-level changes: the possibility to structure a long presentation using sections, which somehow helps. However, as far as I could see, sections are only a grouping feature. There are few operations that can be performed on the section as a whole (as opposed to on all the presentation, or on each slide separately). For some tasks, you can think it is the case (as selecting the section implicitly selects its slides) but you&#8217;ll see that the operation only affected the current slide. Hmm. It can be useful to manage a presentation after it&#8217;s done, but IMO this will reduce the amount of time people spend designing their presentation <span style="text-decoration: underline;">away</span> from powerpoint which is ultimately a bad thing.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_243" style="width: 622px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/ppnt-sections.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-243" title="ppnt sections" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/ppnt-sections.png" alt="Powerpoint sections make it easier to manage very long documents." width="612" height="637" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Powerpoint sections make it easier to manage very long documents.</p></div></p>
<p>Powerpoint 2010 also features 3D transitions not unlike those of Keynote &#8217;08. It is also possible to include movie clips in presentation. Wasn&#8217;t this already the case? Previously, you&#8217;d have to embed video <em>files </em>in your presentations. Now it is possible to embed online videos as well. I&#8217;m not quite sure about these two options really, the first one for ideologic reasons, the 2nd because I wouldn&#8217;t recommend any speaker to rely overly on an internet connection and a video hosting service during a live presentation.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s another thing available everywhere in Office but which is possibly most useful in powerpoint, that is, insert screenshot. By clicking on this button, you have a list of thumbnails of all your open windows to choose from, this really reduces the hassle of using a screen capture tool, or worse, to manually do a screen capture, paste it in an image editing program, crop the image, save it to an acceptable format and copy/paste it again where you need it. It is possible to only copy part of these screens, too. It&#8217; s quite well done.</p>
<h2>Overall impressions</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m impressed with the thinking that went into the interface. The ribbon was already a great demonstration of out-of-the-box thinking and looked great on paper. I wasn&#8217;t thrilled to use it as the commands I had been using for some 15 years were not always easily found, but it seems that first-time users of Office 2007 outweight those who&#8217;ve used previous versions. The execution of the ribbon in Office 2010 is improved, and the team allowed themselves to go beyond some arbitrary constraints they had imposed to themselves, such as the pasting options or the office button. Well done.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy that sparklines have been added to Excel. In the next few years, we&#8217;ll find even better usage for them. However, I&#8217;m disappointed that the charting options remain essentially unchanged. Take the pie chart for instance. Everyone is aware of its limitations. There are many alternatives which would be easy to implement in Excel. Also, I&#8217;m disappointed that the charting mechanism remains the same: present the user with a long list of chart types, without supporting their reasoning in the choice of one over the other. There should be a chart wizard that would ask the user what do they want to show with the data and suggests the best choice (and not many possible choices) of chart.</p>
<p>I am not sure about the improved spell checker. Improved means increased dependency on the tool, which is the reason why typos haven&#8217;t been eradicated despite the technology.</p>
<p>I am very skeptical about all the advances of the Office product into design. Office users are not designers. Or rather, to be a designer requires a specific form of critical reasoning, not a new tool. More sophisticated graphical options allow novice users to achieve complex results without going through that phase of reasoning, which ultimately won&#8217;t help them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine a situation where you have data neatly stored in Excel, in a form you&#8217;re comfortable with (or stuck with) and you want to combine it to create a beautiful HTML document (or XML,  TXT, you name it).<br />
For the sake of argument, let&#8217;s assume you have this spreadsheet here:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="margin-right: 149px; margin-left: 148px;" title="spreadsheet" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/spreadsheet.png" alt="spreadsheet" width="373" height="185" /></p>
<p>and you want to create a list of links with the name of the site in column A, and the url in column B. That, and you want to be able to control every minute aspect of the file you would be creating.</p>
<p>The solution to that problem is the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6kxy1a51(VS.85).aspx">file system object</a> in VBA. You create an object for file operations, like this:</p>
<p><code>Dim fs as Object<br />
Set fs = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")</code></p>
<p>You then create an object per file you want to use:</p>
<p><code>Dim f as Object<br />
Set f = fs.opentextfile("myFile.html", 2, True)</code></p>
<p>What these parameters mean: 2 means the file is open for writing and True that it can be created if it doesn&#8217;t exist</p>
<p>You can then add stuff to your heart&#8217;s content by using the writeline method.</p>
<p><code>f.writeline "&lt;ul&gt;"<br />
f.writeline "  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""" &amp; cells(1,2) &amp; """&gt;" &amp; cells(1,1) &amp; "&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;"<br />
f.writeline "  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""" &amp; cells(1,2) &amp; """&gt;" &amp; cells(1,1) &amp; "&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;"<br />
f.writeline "&lt;/ul&gt;"<br />
</code></p>
<p>And when you&#8217;re done, just close your objects.</p>
<p><code>f.close<br />
</code></p>
<p>Voilà.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-174 aligncenter" style="margin-right: 125px; margin-left: 125px;" title="result" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/result.png" alt="result" width="421" height="152" /></p>
<p>When I use this technique, I like to have procedures that create the files, create a standard header and footer and write to the file using arguments, rather than using the fileSystemObject methods directly. I do that so I can have really clean, indented files with all the structure under control.<br />
Here is a simple example file:</p>
<p><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/fso.xlsm">fso.xlsm</a></p>
<p>And here&#8217;s a more complex project I&#8217;ve done using this technique : <a href="http://www.sourceoecd.org/rpsv/figures2008/en/index.htm">http://www.sourceoecd.org/rpsv/figures2008/en/index.htm</a> where all 240 html pages  (and 52 images) have been generated from content found in Excel documents. If the content and the output is more complex than the above example, the idea is pretty much identical.</p>
