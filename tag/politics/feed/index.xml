				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following my <a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/blog/2012/09/05/which-way-to-the-right/">Tableau politics contest entry</a>, here is another view I had developed but which I didn&#8217;t include in the already full dashboard. </p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0px;" src="http://public.tableausoftware.com/views/politics/DR_EN" scrolling="no" width="710px" height="810px"></iframe></p>
<p>In the <a href="http://public.tableausoftware.com/views/politics/DashEN">main view</a> I have tried to show how the values of candidates relate to those of the French. It&#8217;s difficult to convey that graphically when these values are determined by the answers to as many as 19 questions (and there are many many more that could be used to that effect).</p>
<p>Enter a technique called dimensionality reduction. The idea is to turn a dataset with many dimensions into a dataset with much fewer dimensions, as little as one, two or three. So we compute new variables, so that they capture virtually all the variability of the original dataset. In other words, if two records have different values in the original dataset, they should have different values in the transformed dataset too. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not allergic to words like eigenvalues the math <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">is actually pretty simple</a>. But let&#8217;s not go into that. The point is that with this technique <strong>you can represent a complex dataset as a two-dimensional dataset with very little loss</strong>.</p>
<p>Of course the technique doesn&#8217;t tell you what these new variables represent. Getting a feel for the data I postulate that the one on the X axis represents the toughness of a candidate (pro-security measures, no sensitivity for minorities, etc.) and the one on the Y axis is happiness with previous government. Or possibly, lover of the capitalistic doctrine.</p>
<p>Now you get a better feel for how close or distant the various candidates are from individual voters. You can also see which &#8220;spaces&#8221; remain empty or which are competitive. The top-right quadrant, for instance, looks tempting, but it is really nearly empty (about 200 respondents on over 1500). The right half of the matrix, that is the one which is sensitive to strength, has only one possible competitor but also few voters (~400 respondents). It makes more sense to remain an acceptable choice for the top half (750 voters) and especially the top left (550). In other words the Sarkozy mark should drift slightly towards the top left for optimal impact.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>what led me to those choices</h2>
<p>I was technically happy of my entry for the <a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/blog/2012/06/30/tableau-2012-sports-visualization-contest-entry/">sports contest</a>. I had done what I wanted: obtain a hard-to-find, interesting dataset, attempt to create an exotic, hard-to-make and never-tableau&#8217;d-before shape with aesthetic appeal and insights.</p>
<p>Yet the rules stated that the entries shall be judged on the story-telling front. While there were interesting insights, indeed, they didn&#8217;t constitute a story, a structured narration with a beginning and an end. Having <a href="http://thevcl.com/storytelling/">worked</a> <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2011/11/04/telling-stories-with-data-visweek-2011/">on that subject</a> on occasion, I think there is an inherent contradiction between a dashboard tool that lets a user freely manipulate a bunch of data and that articulated story where the user is more led throughout a process.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what led most of the work.</p>
<p>The second idea was that there is an unspoken, but IMO unnecessary rule about making Tableau dashboards compact things, highly interactive and interconnected. First, the elephant in the room: Tableau public is slow. It&#8217;s too slow. So too many interactions do not make a pleasant experience. Second, it is true that in Tableau one <em>can</em> assemble a dashboard out of interconnected worksheets, where clicking on one makes things happen in another. But just because you can doesn&#8217;t mean you <em>should</em>. Remember the &lt;BLINK&gt; element in the webpage of the 1990s? And this is this interconnectivity that causes dashboards to be compact and fit over the fold. If clicking on one element causes changes on another, you&#8217;d better be able to see both even on a laptop screen.</p>
<p>So the second idea was to create instead a long dashboard where a user would be held by the hand as she&#8217;s taken from point A to point B. Along the way, there would be texts and images to explain what&#8217;s going on, data &#8211; not necessarily interconnected, worksheets with little interactivity which can be understood at first sight, and which can stand some manipulation but don&#8217;t need to.</p>
<p>When visualization and storytelling intersect <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/vozome/dont-take-my-word-for-it-10279298">there is one form that I like</a> which is to start with a preconception and to let the user find through manipulation that this idea is wrong. So I tried to use that in the dashboard as well.</p>
<h2>The subject</h2>
<p>That&#8217;s actually the #1 issue in French politics right now. Which strategy should the main right-wing party adopt? Typically, during the presidential campaign, both large parties fight for the votes of the center and are less radical than usual. But during this campaign the UMP, the party of the former president Nicolas Sarkozy, steered hard to the right in an attempt to steal back the voters gone to the far-right.</p>
<p>Apparently, that strategy was successful, even if he lost the presidential rate, he managed to somehow catch up against his rival.</p>
<p>Yet there are those who argue that if the party was more moderate, it would have been more successful and possibly win.</p>
<p>Anyway. The presidential race is over. But now the party is deciding which way to go next by electing its next leader.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is data that can be used to determine whether the far-right or the moderate strategy can be more fruitful. This is what it is about.</p>
<h2>Making the viz</h2>
<p>Tableau dashboards can go up to 4000px in height, so that&#8217;s what I shot for.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s say it loud and clear, it&#8217;s hell to manipulate large dashboards in Tableau, even with a very strong computer. When you add a new worksheet the legend part and the quickfilter part are added whenever there is room which could be thousands of pixels away. Since you can&#8217;t drag an element across screens you may have to proceed in babysteps. Once there is a certain number of elements, be they text, blanks or very simple and stable worksheets, adding another element takes a very long time, so does moving them around, etc.</p>
<p>As usual fixed size is your only friend, fixed heights, fixed widths, alternating horizontal and vertical layout containers.</p>
<p>So up to the last 2 worksheets there is really nothing to write home about. Only this: when you interact on the published workbook on the web it is painstakingly slow as the dashboard is reloaded and recomputed in its entirety. While this is ok for most of the worksheet, for the most complex one (the one with many sliders) it&#8217;s just unacceptable because the sheet won&#8217;t have time to be redrawn between two interactions.</p>
<p>So I came up with an idea: create a secondary dashboard with just that sheet, publish it independently, and then, in the previous dashboard, I have added a web page object. And that web page pointed to that other dashboard. So in effect, there is a dashboard within a dashboard, so when there is interactions in the complex worksheet, the secondary, smaller dashboard is the only one which is reloaded and recomputed, which is noticeably faster. Still not faster as in fast, but usable.</p>
<p>now publishing aspects aside this worksheet is interesting. The idea is to update a model based on 19 criteria. For every record, the outcome depends the &#8220;closeness&#8221; of the answers of the record and those of the candidates. The 19 parameters control the position of one of the candidates: Nicolas Sarkozy. So what I&#8217;ve done is calculate, outside of Tableau, the &#8220;distance&#8221; between each record and each of the other 8, and in the data file, I&#8217;ve specified that minimal distance and the name of the corresponding candidate. Then, in Tableau, I compute in real time the distance between the record and the parameters, and if that score is inferior to the threshold in the data file, then Sarkozy is deemed to be the closest, else it is the one from the data file. The worksheet tallies up the number of records which are closest to each candidate. Also, in order to keep the parameters legible I have constrained them to 9 values, when they really represent numbers between -2 and 2.</p>
<p>Also for the record, I have made a French and an English version. Why? Because I hope to get the French version published in a media and weight in on the debate, while I need the English version for the contest. This raises a lot of issues, all the worksheets need to exist in 2 versions, many variables need to be duplicated as well. As a sidenote the marks concerning a candidate are colored in tableau blue /orange in English in order to highlight candidate Sarkozy, but according to the campaign colors of the candidates in the French version.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s about it. I hope you enjoy my viz!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>In June 2010, I attended a Wolfram|Alpha event called the London Computational Knowledge Summit where speakers mostly focused on how computers can transform the way we teach and transmit knowledge. Several of the presentations made a lasting impression, and mostly the talk by Jon McLoone:</p>
<pre><code><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/tizMNn6xKFw?version=3&amp;start=380&amp;wmode=transparent" width="600" height="362" style="background-color:#000;display:block;margin-bottom:0;max-width:100%;" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="font-size:11px;margin-top:0;"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tizMNn6xKFw" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube">Watch this video on YouTube</a>.</p></code></pre>
<p>Jon&#8217;s point was that academic papers today look an awful lot like those in the 17th century. Granted, they&#8217;re not in latin, they can be displayed online and there is color, but as far as maths are concerned it&#8217;s still long pages of difficult language and long formulas. The computer, however, can do so much more than transmit information. In the clip above (around 6&#8217;20&#8221;) Jon shows how a paper on edge detection can be much more effective if instead of using a static example to demonstrate the technique, the paper were able to use a live example, such as input from the camera. In that talk and throughout the day, there were more examples on how interactive displays could be useful for teaching.</p>
<p>Teaching, telling stories and getting a message across use similar functions. Fast forward to VisWeek 2010 and the first &#8220;<a href="http://thevcl.com/storytelling/">Telling Stories with Data</a>&#8221; workshop. Some of the presentations there (I&#8217;m thinking of <a href="http://thevcl.com/storytelling/speakers.html#nicholas_diakopoulos">Nick Diakopoulos</a> and <a href="http://thevcl.com/storytelling/speakers.html#matthias_shapiro">Matthias Shapiro</a> mostly) hinted that <strong>there could be a process</strong> through which readers/users/audience could be taken through so <strong>they can make the most of an intended message</strong>. Interestingly, this process is not about transmitting as much data as effortlessly as possible but rather to engage the audience, to get them to challenge their assumptions.</p>
<p>Those two events really made me pause and think. Ever since I had started working in visualization, all my efforts had been focused on being as clear as possible, and my focus, on efficient visuals. However, for some tasks, <strong>clarity just isn&#8217;t optimal</strong>. That wasn&#8217;t much of an issue in most of my OECD work where such an approach makes a lot of sense but I started seeing that there was a world of possibility when it comes to changing people&#8217;s perception on a subject or even persuading them.</p>
<h2>Application</h2>
<h3>French pension reform</h3>
<p>Right at the moment of visWeek 2010, France was plagued by strikes against the proposed pension reform. At the peak of contestation up to 3m people demonstrated (that&#8217;s as much as one adult out of 14). I was quite irritated by the protests. In theory, left and right had very comparable views on this problem and only disagreed on unsignificant details. They both knew reform was unavoidable, and, again, had similar plans. But when those of the current government were implemented, the opposition capitalized on the discontent and attacked the plan vigorously. <strong>Their rethoric were entirely verbal</strong> &#8211; no numbers were harmed in the making of their discourse! Consequently, protesters and a large part of the population started to develop notions about the state of pensions which were completely disconnected from reality.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/stuff/visweek/datastories/index.html"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1143" title="retraites" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/retraites.png" alt="" width="721" height="540" /></a></p>
<p>I believe that if numbers had been used early enough, it would have been enough to provide a counterpoint to such fallacies and while it may not have prevented demonstrations, it would have greatly helped to dampen their effect. With that in mind and with official data I tried to build a model to show what would happen if one changed this or that parameter of pension policy. Pension mechanics are quite simple: what you give on one side, you take on another; the evolution of population is quite well known, so making such a model is pretty straight forward. But putting that in a visual application really showed how the current situation was unsustainable. In this application I challenge the user to find a solution &#8211; any solution &#8211; to the pension problem, by using the same levers as the policy makers. It turns out that there is just one viable possibility. Yet, letting people find that by themselves and challenge that idea as hard as they could was very different from paternalizing and telling people that this was just the way it is.</p>
<p>On the course of the year I got involved in several occasions in situations like this where data visualization could be used to influence people&#8217;s opinion, and likewise I tried to use that approach. Instead of sending a top-down message (with or without data), instead confront the assumptions of the audience and get them to interact with a model. After this experience, their perception will have changed. This technique doesn&#8217;t try to bypass the viewers critical thinking, but instead to leverage their intelligence.</p>
<h3>In politics</h3>
<p>I am very concerned with the use of data visualization in politics for many reasons. One of them is because I&#8217;m a public servant. In my experience, most decisions are not taken by politicians, but by experts or technicians who are commited to the public good. Yet, when poorly  explained, these decisions can be misunderstood and attacked. Visualization, I believe, can help defend such decisions (those who are justifiable at least) and explain them better to a greater number.</p>
<p>Although a lot of data is available out there (or perhaps for that very reason) only few people have a good grasp of the economic situation of their country. This just can&#8217;t be helped. It&#8217;s not possible to increase the percentage of people who can guestimate the unemployment rate and it&#8217;s not really important. Very few people need to know such a number, now what is important is to be able to use that information in context when it is useful. For instance, at election time, a voter should be able to know if the incumbent has created or destroyed jobs. This is something that data visualization can handle brilliantly.</p>
<p>Finally, my issue with political communication is that it is written by activists, for activists. It works well to motivate people with a certain sensitivity but it is not very effective at getting others to change side. This is a bias which is difficult to detect by those in charge of political communications because, well, they&#8217;re activits too&#8230; and here this flavor of model-based data visualization, with its appearance of objectivity and neutrality, can complement the more verbal aspect of rhetoric quite well.</p>
<p>In the talk I used Al Gore&#8217;s <em>An Inconvenient Truth </em>as a counter example. This movie is a fine example of story-telling, and operating at an emotional rather that at a rational novel. I trust that people who feel concerned about climate change will be reinforced in their beliefs after seeing the movie. However, those who do not were unconvinced. In fact, the movie also gave a strong boost to climate skeptics. There was a real barrage of blog posts and websites attempting to debunk the assertions of that &#8220;truth&#8221;, most often with data. There is a missed opportunity: if the really well-made stories of the movie had been complemented with a climate model that people could experiment with, it would have been perceived as less monolithic, less manichean, less dogmatic.</p>
<h2>The conclusions</h2>
<p>In my practice using an interactive model can help <strong>a lot</strong> to get a message across (and no, I don&#8217;t have a rigorous evaluation for &#8220;a lot&#8221;, that&#8217;s the advantage of not being an academic).</p>
<p>Such models <strong>engage the users</strong>, they come out as <strong>more objective and truthful</strong> as static representations, and they can be very useful to <strong>address preconceptions</strong>. Chances are they&#8217;re more fun, too.</p>
<p>Then again, just because a model is interactive and built on transparent data and equations doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s objective. It is usually possible to <strong>control the model</strong> or the interface so that one interpretation is more likely than the other, and that&#8217;s precisely the point if you are using data visualization to influence.</p>
<p>It can be very cheap and easy to turn a static representation into an interactive display. Every chart with more than 2 dimensions can be turned in a visualization where the user controls one dimension and sees data for the others evolve.</p>
<p>And if you build a model like this, you must be very open and transparent about the data and the equations and sometimes find ways to get people to overcome their doubts.</p>
<p>Besides, having a working interactive model is no guarantee of success. You really have to be careful that your users are not likely to interpret your visualization in ways you never intended.</p>
