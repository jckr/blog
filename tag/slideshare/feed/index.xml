<p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/contest/worlds-best-presentation-contest-2009/entries?order=popularity">Slideshare 2009 contest</a> is up again, and there&#8217;s about 1 week to vote. For the contest, I&#8217;m endorsing Dan Roam and counting on everyone to <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/contest/worlds-best-presentation-contest-2009/entries?order=popularity">vote </a>for him and support his <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/danroam/healthcare-napkins-all">presentation</a>. Previous winners of the contest include <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jbrenman/shift-happens-33834">Shift happens</a> or <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jbrenman/thirst">Thirst</a> who got a lot of coverage and views. I think that Dan&#8217;s unique presentation style should get more exposure. One way to see the contest entries is <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/contest/worlds-best-presentation-contest-2009/entries?order=popularity">by votes</a>, so the ones with the most votes show on top. Dan&#8217;s presentation is currently #10, less than 200 votes behind the top spot. But you can only vote once per account. So if you see a presentation you like and give it your vote, it is gone forever.</p>
<p>Dan wrote <em><a href="http://www.thebackofthenapkin.com/">The Back of the Napkin</a></em> which is also the name of the blog he maintains. I enjoyed this book, and I think you should too.</p>
<p>The idea: all of the world&#8217;s problems can be solved by drawing. And even if you think you can&#8217;t draw, as most adults, it&#8217;s much simpler than it seems and it&#8217;s quite fun.</p>
<p>Problems can be reduced to 6 types of questions: who/what, how many, how, where, when and why. Each of these questions can be associated with a broad type of representation, for instance &#8220;where?&#8221; questions can be solved by a map where different elements are plotted. So that&#8217;s one way of categorizing visual representations.</p>
<p>The other axis that the author develops is what he calls SQUID. Depending on your audience, what you want to show may be:</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>s</strong>imple or elaborate,</li>
<li><strong>q</strong>uality vs quantity,</li>
<li><strong>v</strong>ision vs execution,</li>
<li><strong>i</strong>ndividual vs comparison,</li>
<li>change (<strong>D</strong>elta) or as-is.</li>
</ul>
<p>The combination of the SQUID framework and the who, how many, how, where, when, and why questions lead you to one logical choice of representation, which will work make your audience go &#8220;a-ha&#8221; &#8211; guaranteed.</p>
<p>The logic holds, although I feel he tweaked his process for most if not all of the examples in the book. Anyway, this line of thought can easily be reproduced and can solve problems. Now the hand-drawn style is not necessary to this process, but is a nice touch. I&#8217;ve used it in presentations and it gets attention and sympathy. I was amazed to see how much easier and quicker it is to draw a visual that works by hand than with a user-friendly software. I&#8217;m enclined to think that the corporate world would be much more interesting (and fun) if there were more drawings and fewer word documents.</p>
<p>For those reasons, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/danroam/healthcare-napkins-all">go vote for Dan Roam</a>.</p>
<h2>Update</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/contest/worlds-best-presentation-contest-2009">Dan Roam won</a>! congratulations!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There have been many changes in how people understand presentations in 2008. How far have we gone?</p>
<p>In 2008, 2<strong> major books on the topic have been published</strong>. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321525655?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jeromecukiern-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321525655">Presentation Zen</a>, by Garr Reynolds, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596522347?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jeromecukiern-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0596522347">slide:ology</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=jeromecukiern-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0596522347" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />, by Nancy Duarte.</p>
<p><strong>People are accepting that a well-executed presentation can change the world</strong>. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ICL3KG?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jeromecukiern-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000ICL3KG">An Inconvenient Truth</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=jeromecukiern-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000ICL3KG" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> got nothing less than 2 academy awards and a nobel prize. And rumors about the health of master presenter Steve Jobs caused the stock markets to panic.</p>
<p>People are also finding that <strong>tools to create successful presentations are incredibly commonplace</strong>. From a technical standpoint, anyone with a computer could have created &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=1&amp;q=http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DpMcfrLYDm2U&amp;ei=ZexISZ_WN4zY0gXax5wP&amp;sig2=aVpciv4dx5iCWcZLlEr0ag&amp;usg=AFQjCNFCz0fx7wPiD-xtxo89i25mdVC78w">shift happens</a>&#8220;, which has been viewed by 5 to 10 million people.</p>
<p>As a result, <strong>blogs are now swarming with sensible presentation advice</strong>. A google query for &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_By_Powerpoint">death by powerpoint</a>&#8221; returns <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=death+by+powerpoint">397000 hits</a> today. A year ago, searching for presentation tips yielded ideologic (as opposed to evidence-based) guidelines such as &#8220;no more than 7 bullets per slide&#8221; or &#8220;one slide per minute&#8221;. (you can still find those as well).</p>
<p>2008 was also the year where <strong>Slideshare took off</strong>. Not only did the viewership and amount of contents increase drastically, but the quality, relevancy and sophistication of the best presentations is now incredible. Empowered by inspring examples, clear guidelines and adequate tools, many are thriving to emulate great presenters.</p>
<p>So if I just end here, one could conclude that the world is definitely saved from ineffective presentations. The reality is slightly different.</p>
<p>This year, I have seen so far approximately 400 live presentations, and god knows how many online. Some were excellent, many were good, most were at least adequate. But a good proportion of them were still boring and I&#8217;d be lying if I claimed I could remember as much as 10% of them.</p>
<p>One explanation I came up with for that is that many presenters are still focusing on the final deliverable product rather than the fundamentals. These folks are very sensitive to advice like &#8220;mind your typography&#8221;, &#8220;illustrate your slides with large images&#8221;, or &#8220;forget bullets&#8221;. Now typography or images are important and can make a difference between a good and an excellent presentation. But it&#8217;s crucial to have a message to deliver and to focus on that message.</p>
<p>Bulleted texts are accused of cluttering the presentations. But if every little point or anecdote is illustrated with a vividly-colored image, then the images themselves become the clutter and clog everyone&#8217;s limited attention. You&#8217;d remember the images and cool effects but not the point. And a week later, you&#8217;ll have forgotten the images and the presentation altogether.</p>
<p>So my own piece of advice is that your big images won&#8217;t make your presentation. Your angle,  structure and consistency will. The best advice I got from Presentation Zen was to prepare a presentation away from a computer and only produce it once it&#8217;s final. It works. It really does.</p>
<p>Once this will be an accepted practice, seminars, classes and meetings will be much more exciting (let&#8217;s hope!).</p>

<p>Rather than try to cover as much ground as possible, it&#8217;s much more efficient to <strong>focus</strong> on a subject and make sure to deliver.</p>
<p>And if you are expected to deliver lots of information on a wide scope, then a written report is a more appropriate medium. </p>
<p>The presentation should be available in <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">slideshare</a> any time soon.</p>
