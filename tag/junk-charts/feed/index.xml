<p>I&#8217;d like to write a few words about blogs I read regularly and to start this series, I am happy to talk about Junk Charts. </p>
<p><a href="http://junkcharts.typepad.com/">Junk Charts</a> is the one-man crusade of Kaiser Fung against ineffective charts, who has been working on the blog since 2005. Kaiser is a convinced follower of Tufte, whom he owes his blog&#8217;s name. Tufte describes chart junk as whatever clutters graphs and obscures information contained in the chart data. </p>
<p>To this end, Kaiser collects ineffective, misleading or just plain wrong graphs and redraws them according to sound principles. He fights a current trend that gives too much emphasis on the aesthetics of a published graph, to the expense of its meaning. </p>
<p>He is now assisted by readers who gladly submit candidates for redesign. I am grateful that no OECD chart ever had the honors of Junk Charts, although a couple of charts which were direct copies of ours have been featured, such as <a href="http://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/2008/11/dealing-with-skew.html">this one</a>.</p>
<p>In 3 years, Junk Charts has amassed quite a diverse community of readers, and posts are always followed by a healthy discussion &#8211; just what blogging is about. I have found great tips and ideas both in the articles and the comments.</p>
<p>So thank you Kaiser for Junk Charts and I am always looking forward to the next post!</p>
