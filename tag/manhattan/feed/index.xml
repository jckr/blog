<p>Here is my Tableau contest 2011 entry.<br />
The rules stipulated it had to be about business, real-estate or finance, so I chose real-estate. Since everyone loves New-York, and since the data for real-estate transaction is <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dof/html/property/property_val_sales.shtml">relatively easy to get</a>, that&#8217;s what I show. In order to be within Tableau Public 100,000 row limit, I chose to show only the residential transactions (apartment buildings or buildings converted to apartment buildings), larger than 100 square foot and sold at at least $1. </p>
<p>Before I started, I wanted to create a Tableau that would be legible as a static image.<br />
We tableau tribe have seen a lot of interactive dashboards with sophisticated action. Here, I wanted to cater to the discriminate analyst who gets their kicks from seeing patterns emerge with a glance to 90k datapoints. </p>
<p>What does it show for instance? well, while the bulk of transactions are at a price close to the average there are a large part which are done considerably below that, and comparatively, very few which are markedly over that.<br />
The marks which are aligned show either many transactions at the same price (there are distinct $1, $10 and $100 lines for instance) or sales of similar properties. There were a string of sales of identical apartments at 1335 6th Avenue, for instance.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible to switch the function of the Y-axis of the scatterplot, which can either represent square feet or sale price. The largest transaction on the period was around $4 billion, and the largest in terms of area was just above 10m square feet.<br />
It is also possible to explore through the lists on the right. By selecting &#8220;other types&#8221; of buildings for instance you can see which apartment buildings once were yeshivas or fire stations or (what?) &#8220;detention houses for wayward girls&#8221; (there&#8217;s one in upper east side).<br />
You can also switch to a <a href="http://public.tableausoftware.com/views/contest2011/WMap">map-based version of this dashboard</a>. Speaking of maps, a right-click on any mark can open a google maps window centered on that address for you.</p>
<p>So here goes, enjoy the viz and good luck to all contestants</p>
