				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back when I started learning programming, it was always fairly simple to achieve the canonical first step of accomplishments, that is, to get the system to announce that you are ready to do more by displaying &#8220;hello world&#8221; on the screen.</p>
<p>In most systems then, there was a command prompt somewhere that would usually do that when you would type, say:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">PRINT &quot;hello world&quot;</pre>
<p>.</p>
<p>Things have changed a lot since the early 80s. In some fields like fashion, I would argue it&#8217;s a good thing, but we&#8217;re definitely not going in the way of less complexity.</p>
<p>Now if you&#8217;re interested in web-oriented visualization and want to do it with d3.js, it&#8217;s still fairly simple, but it is built upon a number of technologies that you&#8217;re supposed to know a little. Front-end developers live and breathe the web and have been exposed to all things javascript, HTML, CSS, you name it, in enormous doses. Many developers probably have, at some point, tried to interface with the web and know enough of that to get started. So for this crowd, the amount of things you need to know to crack d3 code seems negligible, because they know all that and they are very familiar with it, just as well as people knew the first names of Friends characters by the end of the tenth season.</p>
<p>But what about those who didn&#8217;t? and the people who don&#8217;t see themselves as developers ? do they have to reimmerse themselves in 10 -odd years of web development history to get started? It turns out that this sum of knowledge, while not insurmountable, is certainly not trivial.</p>
<p>So without further ado, let&#8217;s get started</p>
<h1>We&#8217;re cooking an omelette</h1>
<p>And when we do, we need a few things: a pan, a recipe, eggs and stuff, a stove and then plates, knives and forks, etc.</p>
<h2>The pan: a text editor</h2>
<p>The first thing is really the pan. If you don&#8217;t have one when cooking eggs, you borrow one or go buy one. In our analogy the pan is the text editor. This is the tool with which you are going to make the files that will constitute your visualization.</p>
<p>There was a time when it was ok to use notepad (textedit if you are of the apple persuasion). And it&#8217;s still possible, but you are not making your life easier. What I recommend instead is that you get a hold of a copy of SublimeText2. (<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">http://www.sublimetext.com/2</a>). There are windows versions. And Mac versions. And linux versions. For windows users, there is a mobile version so you don&#8217;t need administrator access to install it. There is a free, unlimited evaluation version,  but unless you can&#8217;t spend $69, I strongly recommend that you buy it. Sublime Text 2 has a nearly infinite amount of niceties built in. And unlike some other powerful text editors, where the best features are only understandable by the tech masters, what&#8217;s really nice about Sublime Text 2 is that it would make you gain time even if you are an absolute beginner. One such nice things that it does is detect what language you are working with, automatically color and format the words as you type them depending on the category they fall in, and when possible, suggesting the word you are trying to type, automatically format and indent your code, all in a very unobtrusive and pleasant way. This will really help you troubleshoot problems like strings not closed properly or loose closing bracket which typically consume a lot of time.</p>

<h2>The recipe: a basic file structure</h2>
<p>In d3, you can&#8217;t really type a &#8220;print&#8221; command from a prompt. You need to write some files, which are loaded by a browser (that&#8217;s your &#8220;plate&#8221; in the metaphor, but let&#8217;s not get ahead of ourselves).</p>
<p>You are going to need up to 5 types of files.</p>
<p>First, <strong>an html file</strong>. This will be the file that your browser will read, either locally, or uploaded on a website. We&#8217;ll get to cover this in detail in a minute.</p>
<p>Second, believe it or not, you are going to need the <strong>d3 library</strong>, which is also a file. You may link to the version on the <a href="http://d3js.org/d3.vs.min.js">d3js.org</a> site, and so not worry about having the actual file handy. That has advantages (like the one we just said, also, you&#8217;re pretty sure to always have the latest version on hand), and two problems. First, you always need to have a live internet connection, so there&#8217;s no working in the park outside of free wifi space (for example), and also, it will probably be slower than having the file locally or on your own web space. And if having your own web server seems kind of scary, I&#8217;ll show you in a short while that it&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>The three next kind of files are optional, but hey.</p>
<p>The third file is a <strong>javascript .js file </strong>which would be where you put your code. Some people would rather put all their code in the html file, which is an option, especially for short programs. Personally, I prefer having a separate file. So to make d3 work, you <em>need</em> some script, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be in a separate file.</p>
<p>The fourth file is a <strong>style sheet</strong>, or <strong>css</strong> file. This can be used to define some formatting options, for instance to make all your circles blue by default, or some circles that meet some pre-defined criterion. Like the javascript file, any style information can be contained within the html file, but unlike the script, it is completely optional. I also like to keep it separate from the html.</p>
<p>Finally, you may want a <strong>data file</strong>, you know, with data (csv, txt, json, xml&#8230;). If you have lots of data to visualize, it&#8217;s easier to keep it in separate files than in variables within the script. But it doesn&#8217;t have to be that way. And you could also use d3 without data.</p>
<h2>The ingredients: contents of the files</h2>
<h3>The HTML file</h3>
<p>So let&#8217;s see how this articulates by looking at a typical d3 html file. I am using templates which I try to change as little as possible from project to project.</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
   &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html;charset=utf-8&quot;&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;My project&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;../d3.v2.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;link href=&quot;style.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
   &lt;div id=&quot;chart&quot;&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;script.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p>Well. That is certainly longer than the BASIC one-liner (and we haven&#8217;t <em>even</em> printed &#8220;hello world&#8221; yet).</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take this piece by piece.</p>
<p>The first line is a doctype declaration. What this does is that it tells your browser that what follows should be interpreted as standard, HTML5-compliant HTML (standards mode). If you omit the doctype documentation, your browser will read the html in &#8220;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Mozilla%2527s_Quirks_Mode">quirks mode</a>&#8220;, i.e. by replicating the non-standard behavior of Nescape 4 or IE5. You can still try to run d3 under quirks mode, but don&#8217;t be surprised if your HTML doesn&#8217;t behave as expected.</p>
<p>The doctype declaration doesn&#8217;t have to be more complicated than &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;.</p>
<p>The second line opens the html document proper. Technically, it&#8217;s ok to omit &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; tags in HTML5. The document will still be considered valid by tools like the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C validator</a>. But it seems that some browsers, in some complex cases, don&#8217;t like that so much, and I as a person find it more convenient to find those tags when reading code.</p>
<p>The next line opens the header section of the document. Again, it&#8217;s not absolutely necessary, but I consider it helpful to explicitly differentiate the header from the rest of the document.</p>
<p>The next line, which goes</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html;charset=utf-8&quot;&gt;</pre>
<p>is not absolutely required either. It specifies the encoding of the page, that is, what kind of characters will be seen in the page. Since I use non-ascii characters often, being French and all, I make sure to use it all the time. After all, this is a template, not something I type from beginning to end each time.</p>
<p>Next, we specify a title. This is what will appear in the title area of your browser, or, more likely, as the name of your tab.</p>
<p>In the next line, we load the d3 library. This is my preferred syntax. This is how my files are set up:</p>
<p>I have a directory where all my d3 projects are, and in this directory, I am also keeping (and maintaining reasonably up-to-date) a version of the d3 library, a file called d3.v2.min.js. (min stands for minified, which means that it&#8217;s not meant to be read by persons, but it&#8217;s faster to load). All my projects proper are in folders within that directory. So my html files are one level down from where the d3.v2.min.js file is kept. This is why the src attribute reads &#8220;../d3.v2.min.js&#8221;: the ../ part means, look one level up. If the d3.v2.min.js file were on the same directory where I keep my html, I would write src=&#8221;d3.v2.min.js&#8221;, if I kept it within a specific directory like &#8220;d3&#8243;, I could write src=&#8221;../d3/d3.v2.min.js&#8221;, and finally, there is always the option of getting it from the website, src=&#8221;http://d3js.org/d3.v2.min.js&#8221;.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have to load the d3 library then. I could have done it at the end of the page. The only requirement is that it should be before the script that will use it. But honestly, the file is so small that it doesn&#8217;t make much of a difference (9ms on my machine).</p>
<p>Next, I link to a style sheet. With this syntax, I am assuming that my style is specified in a file called style.css which will be in the same directory as this html page. And if there is no such file, it&#8217;s not a problem. It doesn&#8217;t prevent the page to load.</p>
<p>Instead of using this syntax, I could have written:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">

&lt;style&gt;

... // my style definitions

&lt;/style&gt;

</pre>
<p>in the html file. And frankly, it is sometimes more convenient. But again, for the general case, it&#8217;s just as well to leave it like this.</p>
<p>Note that style information should always be in the header part of the file.</p>
<p>And that concludes the header, as noted by the closing tag &lt;/head&gt;. Even if we use the &lt;head&gt; tag to mark the beginning of the header section, we may omit the closing tag &lt;/head&gt;, and still get away with a valid (and slightly shorter) document, but I keep it for clarity&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p>The next part starts with &lt;body&gt;, and is where the content proper, which will get displayed on the screen, is described. &lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt;, just like &lt;html&gt; and &lt;head&gt;, are not mandatory, but do help, somewhat, to make the document easier to read.</p>
<p>So what do we find in the body section? Here, I&#8217;ve kept it very simple but also close to the conventions I use.</p>
<p>There is one &lt;div&gt; element, which is the basic building block of HTML, and with an id attribute &#8211; a document-wide, unique identifier &#8211; called &#8220;chart&#8221;.</p>
<p>Then, there is the &lt;script&gt; element, which is calling the javascript code we are going to use to create our visualization. It&#8217;s at the very bottom of the page, actually just before the closing tags (which, again, could be omitted, but let&#8217;s not).</p>
<p>Like for the style element, it is possible to leave the script inside the html document. Instead of using a src attribute &#8211; which, incidentally, assumes that the script is within the same directory as the html document with this syntax -, we can write:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">&lt;script&gt;

// all our javascript instructions

&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
<p>And that&#8217;s it for the html document! A final word about the contents of the &lt;body&gt; element. In most of my projects, there is an interface such as buttons or controls which is also done in HTML. In that case, the contents of the &lt;body&gt; element get more complex. I would add a button to tweet the page, copyright notices, and other stuff. But I almost always have a &lt;div&gt; element with an identifier named &#8220;chart&#8221;.</p>
<p>ok, so now that you&#8217;re finished with writing your html file, you must save it under any name and use the &#8220;.html&#8221; extension (or .htm, but why no love for the l? why?)</p>
<h3>The javascript file</h3>
<p>In this section I will walk you through a very, very basic file, which includes things I do for every project.</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
var w=960,h=500,
svg=d3.select(&quot;#chart&quot;)
.append(&quot;svg&quot;)
.attr(&quot;width&quot;,w)
.attr(&quot;height&quot;,h);

var text=svg
.append(&quot;text&quot;)
.text(&quot;hello world&quot;)
.attr(&quot;y&quot;,50);

</pre>
<p>I like to define variables that describe the width and length of the visualization that I am creating. By putting these in variables, at the beginning of the file, I can easily modify them in case I need to. 960 and 500 work well for visualizations that should appear on their own page, by the way. No scrolling should be necessary.</p>
<p>The next statement use the d3.select construct. Here, it indicates that we are going to build something <em>on top </em> of the element that meets the criterion that is described between the parentheses. The syntax used by that is that of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/Getting_Started/Selectors">css selectors</a>, but long story short, #chart refers to whatever has an &#8220;id&#8221; attribute of &#8220;chart&#8221;. This is our lone &lt;div&gt; element in the html file. Then, we are going to add an svg element, which is what will hold the visualization proper in svg form, and give it a width of w and a height of h.</p>
<p>I always use that syntax, an &#8220;svg&#8221; variable that holds the top-level svg container, which resides in a &lt;div&gt; element which has an id of &#8220;chart&#8221;.</p>
<p>The final part of the file writes, finally, hello world proper. Note that I specify a y attribute (vertical position) else the text have its lower-left corner in the top-left corner of the browser window and will be effectively invisible.</p>
<p>Now, the HTML file we just created expect this file to be called &#8220;script.js&#8221;, so let&#8217;s save it under this name.</p>
<p>In this most simple example, we will not need a css file nor a data file. But, for the sake of discussion, let&#8217;s create a css file nonetheless.</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">

text:{font-size:36px;}

</pre>
<p>and let&#8217;s save this under style.css (the name that, again, our HTML file expects). What this does is that it changes the size of the font to whatever the default was to a more massive 36 pixels.</p>
<h2>The stove: a web server</h2>
<p>As far as writing hello world, we&#8217;re done. You can load the html file you created in a browser, you should see the encouraging inscription. Congratulations!</p>
<p>Many visualizations can be seen in a browser directly, just by opening a local file. However, this won&#8217;t be the case for some, for instance, those who require external data. In that case, you need a web server. If you have web hosting, you may upload the files to your (remote) server, via FTP for instance, and see your visualization by typing the address of your site in the browser url bar. That said, it is a good idea to have a local web server, that is, one that runs on your computer, so you can view your files as if they were served by a web server, but with the added bonus that you can edit them and see the modifications directly without having to upload them each time you change them.</p>
<p>On Macs, you&#8217;re pretty much all set. All you have to do is <a href="http://pagekite.net/wiki/Howto/Mac/PersonalWebServer/">enable web-sharing</a> in your system preferences. Then, http://localhost/~YOURNAME will point to /Users/YOURNAME/Sites where YOURNAME is your user name. Just put your files there and go at it.</p>
<p>For windows, there are a bunch of solutions. The &#8220;Professional&#8221; versions of windows include the IIS web server, so, there. But beyond that, there is a lot of web server software available. I personally use <a href="http://www.easyphp.org/">EasyPHP</a>. EasyPHP comes up with a web server (Apache), a mySql database, a PHP preprocessor and other niceties. And, as an aside, it doesn&#8217;t require administrator rights, for you corporate users.</p>
<p>EasyPHP installation is a breeze. When it&#8217;s on, by default, http://localhost/ points to the www/ directory in the install directory of EasyPHP, so you may want to install it in a place that suits you. Alternatively, you can create aliases in the admin panel of EasyPHP (<a href="http://localhost/home/index.php">http://localhost/home/index.php</a>), in other words to give a name to any part of your hard drive. This is what I do, I put all my projects there and have a shortcut to that name in my browser, so whenever I want to see a project I use that shortcut and I can see the visualization as if it were on the web.</p>

<h2>The plate: a browser</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve talked browsers before, and chances are you have one (or several) on your computer.</p>
<p>Now I wish that by browsers, we could just skip it and mean &#8220;the latest version of chrome&#8221;, but it turns out that there are slight differences in the way that browsers handle d3 code so you should really test your work in at least chrome and firefox. As of this writing, Chrome + Firefox (version 5 and up) represent just under 50% of the browser market share. If you add all browsers that are d3-capable (Safari, earlier versions of Firefox, Opera, IE9) you reach about 75% of the market. Sadly, IE8 and IE7 which account for slightly over 20% of the market are not d3-compatible, though they can use the Google <a href="http://www.google.com/chromeframe?hl=en&amp;quickenable=true">ChromeFrame</a> free plug-in and do pretty much all that chrome does.</p>
<h2>Knives and forks: the console</h2>
<p>At the beginning of my dad&#8217;s engineering career, code came on a punch card. People then, allegedly, thought it through. You didn&#8217;t want to be the kid who didn&#8217;t follow your algorithm carefully enough to forecast an avoidable bug and waste a perfectly good card and oh-so precious computing time.</p>
<p>But now? no code is perfect by the time it hits the browser. You may want to launch incomplete code to get a feel for where you&#8217;re going. You may not be too sure of whether that should be a plus or a minus in that equation and just try either because it would be quicker to correct an unexpected outcome than to troubleshoot the formula on paper. You may want to iterate, to bring newer, more complex ideas to your visualization with each change to the code. Or just try out different aesthetic options.</p>
<p>Not too long ago, debugging javascript was really a pain. You&#8217;d have to fire those annoying alert boxes to understand what was the value of the variables, and dispatch them manually. Fortunately, that time is gone and now is the age of the Console.</p>
<p>There are console functionalities for Chrome, Firefox and Safari, and while the interface slightly varies, the idea is the same. The console allows you to do three main things:</p>
<p>&#8211; first, to see if your code executed without errors or warning. Some of those messages can be generated by javascript, and some can be added by you if certain unfortunate conditions are met. You get the position of the error in your code, which helps you to understand what went wrong and fix it.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1437" style="width: 661px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/consoleError.png"><img class=" wp-image-1437 " title="consoleError" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/consoleError.png" alt="" width="651" height="469" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I have planted an error at the end of the code and it&#8217;s been picked up by the console which explains what&#8217;s wrong and when. Notice the red cross in the lower-right corner which counts errors. If there were warning, they would be indicated by a yellow triangle.</p></div></p>
<p>&#8211; second, to inspect elements, that is to find out all the information about the elements displayed on screen, even if (especially if) they have been generated at runtime. So you can see if those elements you really wanted to create have been indeed added, and if the right attributes have been passed.  third, to interact with the code after it&#8217;s run (or while it runs, if you manage to pause if with breakpoints). The most common use of this is, IMO, is to check the value of variables, which you can do simply by typing their name at the console command prompt. But you can also type in one-liner javascript statements, even if they are quite complicated. So it&#8217;s a way to test your code before you write it in your script file.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1439" style="width: 661px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/consoleInspect.png"><img class=" wp-image-1439 " title="consoleInspect" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/consoleInspect.png" alt="" width="651" height="469" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">What a relief! all those paths elements that were supposed to be created in the code have been added as expected.</p></div></p>
<p>&#8211; third, it can be used to interact with the code after it&#8217;s run (or even during run-time, because you can pause the code with breakpoints using the console, but we won&#8217;t go into that). The most common use for that IMO is to check the value of variables, which can be changed during the code execution, but it can also be used to enter one-liner statements, which can be quite complicated. Such a use allows you to test and preview code hypothesis before you write it down in your script file, or to troubleshoot a problem that you could have difficulties seeing outside of the context.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1438" style="width: 661px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/consoleInteract.png"><img class=" wp-image-1438 " title="consoleInteract" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/consoleInteract.png" alt="" width="651" height="469" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Here, I am using the console to check the value of one variable, and to enter a statement that turns all the shapes orange.</p></div></p>
<p>Voilà! the last thing you need when you cook food is people to share it with, same goes for visualizations!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>a couple of days ago I posted the <a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-admin/post.php?post=1185&amp;action=edit">contribution of relative keywords to the earnings of a given movie</a>.</p>
<p>Well, it occurs that the cast of a movie is much easier to obtain than keywords and much less messy. So, I also had scraped the 4 lead actors for each movie of the <a href="www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/2012/01/challenge-of-the-stars/">Beautiful Information awards</a> in order to determine their contribution.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done it slightly differently than with the keywords. I&#8217;ve also taken the budget of the movie into account. So, in order to predict the earnings of a movie, you take the budget, multiply it by 3, remove 8 millions and then add (or remove) the contribution of each star.</p>
<p>Since the movie budget already (mostly <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ) includes the pay of the lead actors, the way to read this contribution is <strong>how much extra these actor should be paid when they appear on film</strong>. For instance, each time Emma Stone does her thing, it would be fair to pay her $500k more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1201" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/emma-stone.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1201" title="emma stone" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/emma-stone.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">the bang being a modest 500k pay raise.</p></div></p>
<p>Likewise, Kirsten Dunst here could be paid an extra 200k per movie, like Rebecca Hall or Rooney Mara. But I mostly felt like posting a picture of Kirsten to stand up against what google autosuggests as keywords when you look her up.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1198" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/kirsten.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1198" title="kirsten" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/kirsten.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kirsten, too, should be paid more.</p></div></p>
<p><a href="http://gifolascage.tumblr.com/">Nicolas Cage</a>, somewhat unsurprisingly,  should refund $2.44m for each movie he stars in.</p>
<p>Actors of movies who&#8217;ve done exceedingly well such as Avatar or the Harry Potter or Twilight sagas, movies which, it&#8217;s fair to say, owe their success to more than the actors, come out of this over valued. And because of how this is calculated, actors who have costarred with them in less ambitious movies come out undervalued: for instance, Elizabeth Banks or Anton Yelchin who both played with Sam Worthington are &#8220;paying&#8221; the fact that Man on the Ledge or Terminator: Renaissance haven&#8217;t been as successful as Avatar.</p>
<p>Twilight fans take note, though, that Harry Potter actors are considered more valuable.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>In June 2010, I attended a Wolfram|Alpha event called the London Computational Knowledge Summit where speakers mostly focused on how computers can transform the way we teach and transmit knowledge. Several of the presentations made a lasting impression, and mostly the talk by Jon McLoone:</p>
<pre><code><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/tizMNn6xKFw?version=3&amp;start=380&amp;wmode=transparent" width="600" height="362" style="background-color:#000;display:block;margin-bottom:0;max-width:100%;" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="font-size:11px;margin-top:0;"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tizMNn6xKFw" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube">Watch this video on YouTube</a>.</p></code></pre>
<p>Jon&#8217;s point was that academic papers today look an awful lot like those in the 17th century. Granted, they&#8217;re not in latin, they can be displayed online and there is color, but as far as maths are concerned it&#8217;s still long pages of difficult language and long formulas. The computer, however, can do so much more than transmit information. In the clip above (around 6&#8217;20&#8221;) Jon shows how a paper on edge detection can be much more effective if instead of using a static example to demonstrate the technique, the paper were able to use a live example, such as input from the camera. In that talk and throughout the day, there were more examples on how interactive displays could be useful for teaching.</p>
<p>Teaching, telling stories and getting a message across use similar functions. Fast forward to VisWeek 2010 and the first &#8220;<a href="http://thevcl.com/storytelling/">Telling Stories with Data</a>&#8221; workshop. Some of the presentations there (I&#8217;m thinking of <a href="http://thevcl.com/storytelling/speakers.html#nicholas_diakopoulos">Nick Diakopoulos</a> and <a href="http://thevcl.com/storytelling/speakers.html#matthias_shapiro">Matthias Shapiro</a> mostly) hinted that <strong>there could be a process</strong> through which readers/users/audience could be taken through so <strong>they can make the most of an intended message</strong>. Interestingly, this process is not about transmitting as much data as effortlessly as possible but rather to engage the audience, to get them to challenge their assumptions.</p>
<p>Those two events really made me pause and think. Ever since I had started working in visualization, all my efforts had been focused on being as clear as possible, and my focus, on efficient visuals. However, for some tasks, <strong>clarity just isn&#8217;t optimal</strong>. That wasn&#8217;t much of an issue in most of my OECD work where such an approach makes a lot of sense but I started seeing that there was a world of possibility when it comes to changing people&#8217;s perception on a subject or even persuading them.</p>
<h2>Application</h2>
<h3>French pension reform</h3>
<p>Right at the moment of visWeek 2010, France was plagued by strikes against the proposed pension reform. At the peak of contestation up to 3m people demonstrated (that&#8217;s as much as one adult out of 14). I was quite irritated by the protests. In theory, left and right had very comparable views on this problem and only disagreed on unsignificant details. They both knew reform was unavoidable, and, again, had similar plans. But when those of the current government were implemented, the opposition capitalized on the discontent and attacked the plan vigorously. <strong>Their rethoric were entirely verbal</strong> &#8211; no numbers were harmed in the making of their discourse! Consequently, protesters and a large part of the population started to develop notions about the state of pensions which were completely disconnected from reality.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://jeromecukier.net/stuff/visweek/datastories/index.html"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1143" title="retraites" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/retraites.png" alt="" width="721" height="540" /></a></p>
<p>I believe that if numbers had been used early enough, it would have been enough to provide a counterpoint to such fallacies and while it may not have prevented demonstrations, it would have greatly helped to dampen their effect. With that in mind and with official data I tried to build a model to show what would happen if one changed this or that parameter of pension policy. Pension mechanics are quite simple: what you give on one side, you take on another; the evolution of population is quite well known, so making such a model is pretty straight forward. But putting that in a visual application really showed how the current situation was unsustainable. In this application I challenge the user to find a solution &#8211; any solution &#8211; to the pension problem, by using the same levers as the policy makers. It turns out that there is just one viable possibility. Yet, letting people find that by themselves and challenge that idea as hard as they could was very different from paternalizing and telling people that this was just the way it is.</p>
<p>On the course of the year I got involved in several occasions in situations like this where data visualization could be used to influence people&#8217;s opinion, and likewise I tried to use that approach. Instead of sending a top-down message (with or without data), instead confront the assumptions of the audience and get them to interact with a model. After this experience, their perception will have changed. This technique doesn&#8217;t try to bypass the viewers critical thinking, but instead to leverage their intelligence.</p>
<h3>In politics</h3>
<p>I am very concerned with the use of data visualization in politics for many reasons. One of them is because I&#8217;m a public servant. In my experience, most decisions are not taken by politicians, but by experts or technicians who are commited to the public good. Yet, when poorly  explained, these decisions can be misunderstood and attacked. Visualization, I believe, can help defend such decisions (those who are justifiable at least) and explain them better to a greater number.</p>
<p>Although a lot of data is available out there (or perhaps for that very reason) only few people have a good grasp of the economic situation of their country. This just can&#8217;t be helped. It&#8217;s not possible to increase the percentage of people who can guestimate the unemployment rate and it&#8217;s not really important. Very few people need to know such a number, now what is important is to be able to use that information in context when it is useful. For instance, at election time, a voter should be able to know if the incumbent has created or destroyed jobs. This is something that data visualization can handle brilliantly.</p>
<p>Finally, my issue with political communication is that it is written by activists, for activists. It works well to motivate people with a certain sensitivity but it is not very effective at getting others to change side. This is a bias which is difficult to detect by those in charge of political communications because, well, they&#8217;re activits too&#8230; and here this flavor of model-based data visualization, with its appearance of objectivity and neutrality, can complement the more verbal aspect of rhetoric quite well.</p>
<p>In the talk I used Al Gore&#8217;s <em>An Inconvenient Truth </em>as a counter example. This movie is a fine example of story-telling, and operating at an emotional rather that at a rational novel. I trust that people who feel concerned about climate change will be reinforced in their beliefs after seeing the movie. However, those who do not were unconvinced. In fact, the movie also gave a strong boost to climate skeptics. There was a real barrage of blog posts and websites attempting to debunk the assertions of that &#8220;truth&#8221;, most often with data. There is a missed opportunity: if the really well-made stories of the movie had been complemented with a climate model that people could experiment with, it would have been perceived as less monolithic, less manichean, less dogmatic.</p>
<h2>The conclusions</h2>
<p>In my practice using an interactive model can help <strong>a lot</strong> to get a message across (and no, I don&#8217;t have a rigorous evaluation for &#8220;a lot&#8221;, that&#8217;s the advantage of not being an academic).</p>
<p>Such models <strong>engage the users</strong>, they come out as <strong>more objective and truthful</strong> as static representations, and they can be very useful to <strong>address preconceptions</strong>. Chances are they&#8217;re more fun, too.</p>
<p>Then again, just because a model is interactive and built on transparent data and equations doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s objective. It is usually possible to <strong>control the model</strong> or the interface so that one interpretation is more likely than the other, and that&#8217;s precisely the point if you are using data visualization to influence.</p>
<p>It can be very cheap and easy to turn a static representation into an interactive display. Every chart with more than 2 dimensions can be turned in a visualization where the user controls one dimension and sees data for the others evolve.</p>
<p>And if you build a model like this, you must be very open and transparent about the data and the equations and sometimes find ways to get people to overcome their doubts.</p>
<p>Besides, having a working interactive model is no guarantee of success. You really have to be careful that your users are not likely to interpret your visualization in ways you never intended.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[In my short tutorial on <a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/?p=426">working with data and protovis</a> I briefly covered some standard javascript and protovis methods to <a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/?p=494">work with arrays</a>.

The more I work with Protovis, the more I am convinced that efficient array manipulation is key to achieving just about anything with the library. So, I would like to go into more detail in some javascript methods for building, processing and testing arrays that can really be helpful.
<h3>Going through arrays: map and forEach</h3>
I said rapidly that the map method was very useful in protovis especially used in combination with pv.range.
But that's not very fair to map() to be treated this lightly.
Protovis <a href="http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/ex/">canon examples</a> do not use many traditional loops such as <em>for </em> or <em>while</em> statements.
One reason for that is that many constructs in protovis are <em>de facto</em> loops: when we pass an array to protovis as a data file, to create a bar chart for instance (or panels, pie wedges, you name it), it will go through each element of the array to create individul bars (panels, wedges...), to position them, style them, and so on and so forth. This is why it is so important to have your <strong>data elements in the best possible shape</strong> when you first pass them to protovis. It makes the rest of your code much nicer.

Remember our early example:
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">var categories = [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;,&quot;e&quot;,&quot;f&quot;];
var vis = new pv.Panel()
  .width(150)
  .height(150);

vis.add(pv.Bar)
  .data([1, 1.2, 1.7, 1.5, .7, .3])
  .width(20)
  .height(function(d) d * 80)
  .bottom(0)
  .left(function() this.index * 25)
  .anchor(&quot;bottom&quot;).add(pv.Label)
    .text(function() categories[this.index]);

vis.render();
</pre></td>
<td><a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/categories.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-483" title="categories" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/categories.png" alt="" width="144" height="135" /></a></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
This is not ideal to have values and categories in two separate places, because one could be changed without updating the other.
So let's try to use map to create one single variable.

<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">var categories = [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;,&quot;e&quot;,&quot;f&quot;];
var data=[1, 1.2, 1.7, 1.5, .7, .3].map(function(d,i) {return {value:d, key: categories[i]};});</pre>

Let's look at our map() method here.
First, it's right after an array. It will run against this array, so it will perform an operation on each element of this array, and the result will be another array of the same size with the outcome of each operation in the same order.
The next thing here is a function with two arguments: d and i. Again the naming is arbitrary, call them what you want. And they are both optional. But it has to be a function. pv.range(3).map(3) will not return [3,3,3], you need to write pv.range(3).map(function() 3).

The first argument refers to the current item of the array map is working on. So 1, then 1.2, etc. If the array is more complex, and is an array of arrays or similar, the current element can be itself an array, an object or anything. It doesn't have to be a number.
Here, we want to create an array of associative arrays where the value handle corresponds to the values of the array, and where key corresponds to the category name.
So we start our output by "{value: d,". This puts the value of each array element in sequence where we need it to be.

The second argument corresponds to the index of the current item in the array, so - 0, 1, 2 etc. This is not unlike using "this.index" in other parts of protovis. This helps us getting the right category name, the one in the same position as the value we are fetching. So we write "key: categories[i]}".
The rest of the code can then be changed to :

<pre class="brush: jscript; first-line: 6; title: ; notranslate">vis.add(pv.Bar)
  .data(data)
  .width(20)
  .height(function(d) d.value * 80)
  .bottom(0)
  .left(function() this.index * 25)
  .anchor(&quot;bottom&quot;).add(pv.Label)
    .text(function() d.key);
vis.render();</pre>

Now how about forEach()?
forEach works in a very similar way to map(), the difference is that it doesn't output an array. It's just a function that runs on each element of the array. It can be used to perform an operation a number of times corresponding to the length of that array, for instance.
<h3>Testing arrays</h3>
There are some times when you need to know whether some or all the elements of your array fulfill a condition. And some other times, you need to be able to extract a subset of your array also on a conditional basis. Now, that would be possible using forEach or map methods as above, but fortunately javascript provides simpler means to achieve that.
<h4>Testing a condition on an array at once</h4>
There are two methods that do that: every() and some(). every() will return true is the condition is true for, well, every element of the array. some() will return true if the condition is true for at least one element of the array. So, they can also be used to tell if the condition is false for at least one element of the array, or all elements of the array respectively.

This is how they work:

<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">[0,1,2].every(function(d) {return d;})
// will return false: 0 is false, 1 is true and 2 is true.
[0,1,2].every(function(d) {return (d&lt;3);})
// will return true. All elements are less than 3.

[0,1,2].some(function(d) {return d;})
// will return true. 1 is true, so at least one element in the array is true.
</pre>

<h4>Creating conditional subsets of an array</h4>
It is also possible to get only the elements that fit a condition using the filter() method.

<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
[0,1,2].filter(function(d) {return d;})
// this will return [1,2]. 0 is evaluated as &quot;false&quot;.
</pre>

<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
[1,2,3,4,5].filter(function(d) {return (d&gt;2);})
// this will return [3,4,5].
</pre>

Of course, the more complex the array, the more interesting these functions get. 
With the barley array from <a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/?p=502">part 4</a>:

<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate"> barley.filter(function(d) {return d.variety==&quot;Manchuria&quot;;}
/* this will return: 
  [{&quot;yield&quot;:27,&quot;variety&quot;:&quot;Manchuria&quot;,&quot;year&quot;:1931,&quot;site&quot;:&quot;University Farm&quot;},
   {&quot;yield&quot;:48.86667,&quot;variety&quot;:&quot;Manchuria&quot;,&quot;year&quot;:1931,&quot;site&quot;:&quot;Waseca&quot;},
   {&quot;yield&quot;:27.43334,&quot;variety&quot;:&quot;Manchuria&quot;,&quot;year&quot;:1931,&quot;site&quot;:&quot;Morris&quot;},
   {&quot;yield&quot;:39.93333,&quot;variety&quot;:&quot;Manchuria&quot;,&quot;year&quot;:1931,&quot;site&quot;:&quot;Crookston&quot;},
   {&quot;yield&quot;:32.96667,&quot;variety&quot;:&quot;Manchuria&quot;,&quot;year&quot;:1931,&quot;site&quot;:&quot;Grand Rapids&quot;},
   {&quot;yield&quot;:28.96667,&quot;variety&quot;:&quot;Manchuria&quot;,&quot;year&quot;:1931,&quot;site&quot;:&quot;Duluth&quot;},
   {&quot;yield&quot;:26.9,&quot;variety&quot;:&quot;Manchuria&quot;,&quot;year&quot;:1932,&quot;site&quot;:&quot;University Farm&quot;},
   {&quot;yield&quot;:33.46667,&quot;variety&quot;:&quot;Manchuria&quot;,&quot;year&quot;:1932,&quot;site&quot;:&quot;Waseca&quot;},
   {&quot;yield&quot;:34.36666,&quot;variety&quot;:&quot;Manchuria&quot;,&quot;year&quot;:1932,&quot;site&quot;:&quot;Morris&quot;},
   {&quot;yield&quot;:32.96667,&quot;variety&quot;:&quot;Manchuria&quot;,&quot;year&quot;:1932,&quot;site&quot;:&quot;Crookston&quot;},
   {&quot;yield&quot;:22.13333,&quot;variety&quot;:&quot;Manchuria&quot;,&quot;year&quot;:1932,&quot;site&quot;:&quot;Grand Rapids&quot;},
   {&quot;yield&quot;:22.56667,&quot;variety&quot;:&quot;Manchuria&quot;,&quot;year&quot;:1932,&quot;site&quot;:&quot;Duluth&quot;}]*/</pre>
<h3>Visualizing arrays</h3>
(without plotting them, of course)
When you are manipulating arrays, turning them into maps, performing roll-ups and sorts, you may want to get a glimpse of the array. But, unless it's a single, one-dimensional array, firebug or chrome debugger will represent it as a cryptic [ > Object, > Object, > Object ]. 

Not being able to follow step by step what's happening to an array makes understanding the data functions much more difficult. 
Fortunately, you can use the JSON.stringify() method.

<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">JSON.stringify(barley)
/*returns: 
&quot;[
{&quot;yield&quot;:27,&quot;variety&quot;:&quot;Manchuria&quot;,&quot;year&quot;:1931,&quot;site&quot;:&quot;University Farm&quot;},

No matter the manipulations you inflict to an array you will always be able to make it reveal its innards by using this.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is a map?</h2>
<p>before we start looking at the code it may be a good idea to think of the best way to represent a country.<br />
Countries are areas of land surrounded by borders, which are imaginary (or sometimes physical) <strong>lines</strong> going through a set of <strong>points</strong>.<br />
<a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/square.png"><img src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/square.png" alt="" title="square" width="200" height="200" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-748" /></a></p>
<p>Some countries are made of one of such surfaces, but many countries are not one contiguous territory (they may include islands for instance) so they could be made out of <strong>several disjointed polygons</strong>.<br />
<a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/square1.png"><img src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/square1.png" alt="" title="square" width="200" height="200" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-749" /></a>.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s put on our protovis hat. Let&#8217;s suppose we want to draw a map where each country could be colored differently (choropleth). What kind of data structure should be use to represent that?<br />
First there should be a sort of array of countries. Each country should be an item in that array, so they can be indexed and assigned an individual color and various data points.<br />
Then, at the lowest level, we would be drawing polygons, which are treated as pv.Line in protovis. For each polygon, we would require an array of coordinate pairs. To draw a country, we would need a list (array) of those polygons. </p>
<p>So the data structure we are looking at is: </p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">var world=[  // an array of countries
    [ // an array of polygons
        [ // an array of pairs of coordinates
            [x0, y0], // coordinates of the first point
            [x1, y1], // coordinates of the next one
                ... 
            [xn, yn],
            [x0, y0]  // coordinates of the first point to close the polygon
        ]
       ...              // another polygon, but maybe not.
   ], 
   [                    // next country
  ...
   ]
...
]</pre>

    .lineWidth(1)
    .interpolate(&quot;cardinal&quot;)
    .antialias(false);

vis.render();
</pre>
<p>In addition there are two arrays of the following shape:<br />
First, stats which is an associative arrays of associative arrays, and which associate each 2-letter country code with values of population and area:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; light: true; title: ; notranslate">
var stats = {
'AG': {pop:83039, area:44},
'DZ': {pop:32854159, area:238174},
...
'US': {pop:299846449, area:915896},
...
};
</pre>
<p>Then, countries, which is an array of associative arrays.</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; light: true; title: ; notranslate">
var countries = [
{code:'AG', name:&quot;Antigua and Barbuda&quot;, 
borders:[ // an array of one or several areas, 
  [ // an array of coordinates, 
    [ // a pair of the form longitude, lattitude
       ...
    ]
  ]
]}
...
]</pre>
<p>Now this second data structure looks a lot like the one we&#8217;ve drafted in the prologue. All the geographic information is tucked in a property called &#8220;borders&#8221;. The array has other properties for comfort.<br />
Because the data is put in the right shape and order, this script can produce a very good map with a remarkable economy of code.<br />
This example has been put together to showcase the various map projections of protovis (identity, mercator, and so on.). These projections have zero impact on the way data should be assembled for making maps, so we&#8217;ll just treat them as &#8220;magic&#8221;. </p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">/*
 * A diverging color scale, using previously-computed quantiles of population
 * densities; in the future, we might use a quantile scale here to do this

 */
var fill = pv.Scale.linear()
    .domain(140, 650, 1900)
    .range(&quot;#91bfdb&quot;, &quot;#ffffbf&quot;, &quot;#fc8d59&quot;);
</pre>
<p>This part creates a color scale which will return a color according to the value passed to it. The color returned will be somewhere between the ones specified in the range, depending on where the value is relatively to the values specified in the domain. So a value of 140 will result in a color of #91bfdb (bluish), it will go towards the grey as the value moves up to 650, and towards #fc8d59 (redish) as the value goes up to 1900.</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; first-line: 11; title: ; notranslate">/* Precompute the country's population density and color. */
countries.forEach(function(c) {
  c.color = stats[c.code].area
      ? fill(stats[c.code].pop / stats[c.code].area)
      : &quot;#ccc&quot;; // unknown
});</pre>
<p>As the remark says, this will precompute the country&#8217;s color once and for all.<br />
The <a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/?p=494">forEach() method</a> goes to every element of the countries array.<br />
the c.color = statement will add a color key to each element of that array (which, as you may recall, already has values for the code, name and borders keys.<br />
What it does is that is retrieves the country code of that element of countries, c.code, and uses that to find out whether we have an area value for that country code (this is stats[/c].area?).<br />
If this is the case, we are going to compute the color that should be attributed to the country, by passing the population divided by the area to the color scale we just made. Else, we just use light grey.</p>
<p>The next few lines are standard constants that will shape the vis.<br />
Note however </p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; first-line: 20; title: ; notranslate">geo = pv.Geo.scale(&quot;hammer&quot;).range(w, h)</pre>
<p>This is a geographic scale, which will be used to convert longitudes and latitudes to X and Y coordinates on the screen.</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; first-line: 26; title: ; notranslate">/* Countries. */
vis.add(pv.Panel)
    .data(countries)
  .add(pv.Panel)
    .data(function(c) c.borders)
  .add(pv.Line)
    .data(function(b) b)
    .left(geo.x)
    .top(geo.y)
    .title(function(d, b, c) c.name)
    .fillStyle(function(d, b, c) c.color)
    .strokeStyle(function() this.fillStyle().darker())
    .lineWidth(1)
    .antialias(false);</pre>
<p>This is where it all happens.<br />
First, we create a series of panels, one for each country. So, we pass the countries array as data.<br />
Then, we are going to create another series of panels for every country, that is, with as many panels as there are independent areas in the country. For instance, if there are islands, we are going to need extra panels to represent them. If the country is one contiguous mass of land, there will be just one panel here.<br />
This time, we use function(c) c.borders as data. That is, we go into the borders array.</p>
<p>Finally, we are going to create a filled polygon for each of these independent areas. This is achieved by adding a pv.Line to the previous panels. Likewise, we use (function(b) b) as data, meaning that we go yet another level into the borders array. Now, we are accessing the pairs of longitude + latitude numbers.</p>
<p>geo.x and geo.y convert this pair of numbers to X and Y coordinates on the screen.<br />
For the next two lines, title and fillStyle, we need to go back to the country level.<br />
so, we use a function of the form <a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/?p=479">function(d,b,c)</a>. d is the current item (pair of longitude, latitude), b its parent (individual area) and c, its grand-parent (the country).<br />
so, function(d,b,c) c.name retrieves the country name, and function(d,b,c) c.color retrieves the color we had computed for that country to begin with.</p>
<p>For the color of the border, we wish to use a darker version of the fill color. This is what the this.fillStyle().darker() does.</p>
<p>The rest of the vis is longitude and latitude ticks, using the built-in properties of the scale.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I started using <a href="http://www.protovis.org/">protovis </a>I had only a very basic knowledge of javascript, which in theory isn’t a problem as protovis is meant to be learned by example, and as it has its own logic and structure which is different from typical javascript code. So I started by looking and modifying examples which was enough to do basic stuff.<br />
But I soon felt limited by what hid behind a single property: <strong>data</strong>. I knew that protovis had lots of features to manipulate and process data but they were not obvious from the examples.</p>
<p>I mean,</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="640">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">var vis = new pv.Panel()
.width(150)
.height(150);

vis.add(pv.Bar)
.data([1, 1.2, 1.7, 1.5, .7, .3])
.width(20)
.height(function(d) d * 80)

vis.render();</pre>
</td>
<td><a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/basic-example1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-433" title="basic example" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/basic-example1.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Here, it’s pretty obvious that the bars represent the values 1, 1.2, 1.7, 1.5, 0.7 and 0.3 respectively. One can infer that the sizes of bars are 25 pixels wide and 80 times their value long.</p>
<p>But protovis doesn’t usually look like this “hello world” kind of example, but rather like this:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
/* Compute yield medians by site and by variety. */
function median(data) pv.median(data, function(d) d.yield);
var site = pv.nest(barley).key(function(d) d.site).rollup(median);
var variety = pv.nest(barley).key(function(d) d.variety).rollup(median);
/* Nest yields data by site then year. */
barley = pv.nest(barley)
    .key(function(d) d.site)
    .sortKeys(function(a, b) site[b] - site[a])
    .key(function(d) d.year)
    .sortValues(function(a, b) variety[b.variety] - variety[a.variety])
    .entries();
[. . .]
/* A panel per site-year. */
var cell = vis.add(pv.Panel)
    .data(barley)
    .height(h)
    .top(function() this.index * h)
    .strokeStyle(&quot;#999&quot;);</pre>
<p>What just happened? <a href="http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/jsdoc/symbols/pv.Nest.html">pv.nest</a>, key, rollup, sortKeys, entries – what could that do?</p>
<p>To go beyond merely touching up examples, and do your own visualizations from scratch, it is important to get a good grip on how to feed protovis with data. In order to do so, you need a few javascript notions.</p>
<h2>Arrays, arrays, how do they work?</h2>
<p>In javascript, an array is an ordered list of stuff.</p>
<p>In our initial example, we had one such list:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; light: true; title: ; notranslate">[1, 1.2, 1.7, 1.5, .7, .3]</pre>
<p>Anything can be put in an array: numbers, strings, Booleans (true/false values), objects … including other arrays. All elements of an array don’t have to be of the same type. Arrays can be assigned to a variable.</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; light: true; title: ; notranslate">var a = [1, 1.2, 1.7, 1.5, .7, .3];</pre>
<p>Elements of the array can be accessed using the [] notation. In javascript, indices start at 0, so the first element of an array can be obtained so:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; light: true; title: ; notranslate">a[0];</pre>
<p>This returns 1. Javascript has many functions to create and manipulate arrays, which we will talk about later. For the time being, let’s look at arrays of arrays. If we wrote instead:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; light: true; title: ; notranslate">var a = [[1, 1.2], [1.7, 1.5], [.7, .3]];</pre>
<p>a is now an array of arrays, or “multi-dimensional array”.</p>
<p>a[0] is now worth [1, 1.2]. To access the first number of the array, one has to write a[0][0], which will return the first element (1) of the first element ([1, 1.2]) of a.</p>
<p>Javascript also has another type of array called associative arrays, where values are assigned to keys instead of an index. For instance,</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; light: true; title: ; notranslate">var a = {yield: 27.00000, variety: &quot;Manchuria&quot;, year: 1931, site: &quot;University Farm&quot;};</pre>
<p>is an associative array. To access a value, one can use a . operator:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; light: true; title: ; notranslate">a.yield</pre>
<p>will retun 27.</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; light: true; title: ; notranslate">a[&quot;yield&quot;]</pre>
<p>also works.</p>
<p>Like other variable types, it is possible to have an array of associative arrays. In fact, this is used quite often in protovis.</p>
<h2>Protovis and arrays – deconstructing the first example</h2>
<p>The reason why I introduced javascript arrays is that the data property <span style="text-decoration: underline;">requires an array</span>. Protovis then loops through that array, performing operations on each of its elements. To that end, it uses things such as accessor functions and properties of an object called this.</p>
<p>To explain all of this let’s go back to the first example and analyse it line by line.</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">var vis = new pv.Panel()
  .width(150)
  .height(150);
vis.add(pv.Bar)
  .data([1, 1.2, 1.7, 1.5, .7, .3])
  .width(20)
  .bottom(0)
  .height(function(d) d * 80)
  .left(function() this.index * 25);
vis.render();</pre>
<p>The first 3 lines create a panel, which is like the sheet of paper on which protovis will draw the chart. Its width and height properties must be filled, as they are 0 by default which would make the whole visualization invisible.</p>
<p>The next line adds a bar chart to this panel we’ve just created.</p>
<p>The line after specifies the data on which to work: here comes our array. Here, we have written the array literally in the data property, but nothing prevents us to assign it to a variable first and to pass the variable instead.</p>
<p>The next line, and the line with the bottom property, assign constant numbers to these properties. It means that all the bars will have a width of 20 pixels, and they will all be aligned with the bottom of the panel – that’s what</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; first-line: 7; title: ; notranslate">bottom(0)</pre>
<p>does.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the two remaining lines:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; first-line: 8; title: ; notranslate">.height(function(d) d * 80)
.left(function() this.index * 25);</pre>
<p>The first line uses an accessor function. What this does is that it looks at the current element, and perform an operation on it, the result of which will be the height of that element.</p>
<p>In proper javascript, we would have written:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; light: true; title: ; notranslate">function(d) {return d*80;}</pre>
<p>but protovis uses a shorthand notation that allows us to omit curly braces and the return statement. By the way, d in the function is completely arbitrary, and could be any variable name –</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; light: true; title: ; notranslate">function(a) a*80</pre>
<p>also works. It’s just that the name of the variable between parentheses will represent the value of the current element.</p>
<p>The second line uses the this object. this represents what protovis is working on at the moment, and it has properties that can be used. The most commonly used is index: this.index returns the position of the current element in its array, so it is going to be: 0 for the first bar, 1 for the next one, etc.</p>
<p>So this line specifies that each new bar should start every 25 pixels from the left border of the panel.</p>
<p>You may wonder, why not write</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; light: true; title: ; notranslate">.left(this.index * 25);</pre>
<p>and omit the function()? Well, function() means that the content of the property gets re-evaluated. If we had omitted it, this.index * 25 would have been computed once (for a result of 0) and that value would have been used for all the bars.</p>
<p>By the way, instead of writing the height property as it is, we could have written:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; light: true; title: ; notranslate">.height(function()[1, 1.2, 1.7, 1.5, .7, .3][this.index] * 80)</pre>
<p>Using an accessor function is shorter and clearer.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Changing driving behaviors with campaigning alone is a tall order, but is literally a life-or-death matter. Road fatalities range from about 40/million  in Japan, to about 6 times as much in Russia. Fortunately, the numbers tend to decrease in most places, due to better equipment, better roads, harsher punishment and safer behaviors.</p>
<p>Of all of these factors, drivers behavior is the only thing which isn&#8217;t directly controlled by governments, so it&#8217;s no surprise that it&#8217;s what the agencies try to target. Almost every angle has been tried: blaming alcohol, speed, showing the consequences of seemingly inocuous oversights, and, obviously, gore and shocking images.</p>
<p>This year, in France, they&#8217;ve tried a different approach with a campaign called <a href="http://www.les12000.fr/">the 12000</a>: thanking the drivers for their better behavior, which has saved, well, 12000 lives since 2003.</p>
<p>I really appreciate the upbeat <a href="http://www.securiteroutiere.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/40x60_CAROLINE_BD_cle23a2aa.pdf">tone of campaign</a> and its much welcome positive spin. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s based on such fallacy that it&#8217;s difficult to accept as such.</p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-157" style="clear:right;" title="road1" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/road1.png" alt="road1" width="384" height="287" /></p>
</div>
<p>Here&#8217;s one view of what has happened. The number of fatalities has dropped since 2003. (By the way, the unit for this and the following chart are fatalities per million population, indexed so that the value for France in 2003 is 100). It can be argued that lives have been saved, because if the number of fatalities had remained constant since 2003, the area in green would represent extra fatalities (around 6,000).</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s what the agency wants us to believe.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-159" style="clear:both;" title="road21" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/road21.png" alt="road21" width="383" height="287" /></p>
<p>Says the <a href="http://www.les12000.fr/">website</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>12000 lives have been saved between 2003 and 2008. <strong>Fatalities have dropped from 6126 in 2003 to 4275 in 2008</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>To actually come up with that number of 12000 person saved, they&#8217;ve simply multiplied the difference between the 2008 and 2003 figures by 6. As if there had been a sudden and drastic drop in 2003.</p>
<p>I wonder why they do that. Behaviors have changed on the road. 75% of French drivers have a perfect driving record, another 15% have only committed minor offences. Those are facts. So why inflate the numbers? and why, for instance, start at 2003 and not 2002, where mortality dropped by over 20% ? 12000, as an absolute figure, is not more striking than 1000 or 100000.</p>
<p>The visuals all repeat this figure. On all the posters of the campaign, we find the following footnote: &#8220;* If behaviors had not changed since 2002 in France, 12000 more people would have died on the road between 2003 and 2008. Source: ONISR. &#8220;. The ONISR says no such things in their report, so that number must have been invented for the campaign.</p>
<p>Speaking of the <a href="http://www2.securiteroutiere.gouv.fr/IMG/Synthese/dep_accidentologie.pdf">ONISR reports</a>, they estimate that if people observed speed, alcohol and seat belt legislations, the numbers would drop by over 2000. So are we doing that well?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-160" style="clear:both;" title="road3" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/road3.png" alt="road3" width="384" height="287" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a comparison with the UK. Again, the units are ratio per population, not absolute figures. If France had the same road fatalities that the UK, over 10,000 persons would not have been killed over the 2003-2008 period&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway. There&#8217;s no good reason why all western countries couldn&#8217;t go under 50 killed / million population within a reasonably short time frame.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two weeks ago I have been at <a href="http://DD4D.net/">DD4D</a> conference, conveniently located at my workplace. I will write some more on DD4D, meanwhile you can see this post on <a href="http://infosthetics.com/archives/2009/07/dd4d_conference_coverage_best-of.html">infosthetics </a>by <a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~pneumann/">Petra</a> and <a href="http://www.mariandoerk.de/">Marian</a>.  One of the things that struck me at DD4D was that several talks were about either data visualization for advocacy, or for education purposes. One speaker said that data visualization could be used to <strong>protect </strong>people <strong>against those who</strong> use numbers to <strong>mislead and disinform</strong>.  Yesterday, I saw this typical example of such a manipulation, reminding of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies,_damned_lies,_and_statistics">the famous Disraeli quote</a>.<br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-154" title="disinform" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/disinform.png" alt="disinform" width="440" height="309" /></p>
<p>This is a poster for restaurants to display. Yesterday, VAT for restaurants in France was cut from 19.6% to 5.5%. This is the result over 10 years of lobbying. Initially, restaurants asked for a VAT drop and committed to cut their listed prices accordingly. That cut in price would have attracted more consumers, eventually generating more profit and possibly more tax money. That would have been a win-win-win situation for the restaurant industry, the consumer and the state.</p>
<p>But eventually, the changes that restaurants have agreed to their price structure are as follow. They would cut the listed price of up to 10 menu items by 11.8% to &#8220;reflect the tax drop&#8221;. In exchange, they are allowed to display this poster, on which the <strong>c</strong><strong>hart ominously promises a massive price drop</strong>.</p>
<p>In reality, 11.8% is not enough to offset the VAT drop.</p>
<p>That should have been approximately 13.4%  or 100*(1.196/1.055 &#8211; 1) . Fast-food chains only have to drop some of their prices by 5% to get the poster.</p>
<p>The poster claims: &#8220;a cut in VAT is a cut in prices!&#8221;. But what happens really? For most items, listed price (incl tax) is unchanged, which means their actual <strong>prices</strong> <strong>raise by 13.4%</strong>. And for the discounted items, the sales price excluding tax still raises by 1.4% (or 7.7% for fast-food chains).</p>
<p>Is this what was implied by the chart?</p>
<p>In the past two weeks, I have collected more examples of shameless lies backed by seemingly official numbers and charts, and will continue to collect them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In March this year, überscientist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram">Stephen Wolfram</a>, of <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/products/mathematica/index.html">Mathematica </a>fame, revealed the world he was working on something new, something big, something different. The first time I heard of this was through semantic web prophet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Spivack">Nova Spivack</a>, who is not known to get excited by less-than-revolutionary projects. That, plus the fact that the project was announced so short before its release, contributed to build anticipation to huge levels.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-146" title="wolframalpha" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/wolframalpha-275x300.png" alt="wolframalpha" width="275" height="300" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">Wolfram|alpha</a> describes itself as a &#8220;computational knowledge engine&#8221; or, simply put, as an &#8220;answer engine&#8221;. Like google and search engines, it tries to provide information based on a query. But while search engines simply try to retrieve the keywords of the query in their indexed pages, the answer engine tries to understand the query as a question and forms an educated answer. In a sense, this is similar to the <a href="http://www.freebase.com/">freebase</a> project, which is to put all the knowledge of a world in a database where links could be established across items.</p>
<p>It attempts to detect the nature of each of the word of the query. Is that a city? a mathematic formula? foodstuff? an economic variable? Once it understands the terms of the query, it gives the user all the data it can to answer.</p>
<p>Here for instance:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-147" title="wolframalpha-2" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/wolframalpha-2.png" alt="wolframalpha-2" width="445" height="1052" /></p>
<p>Using the same <strong>find </strong>&gt; <strong>access </strong>&gt; <strong>process </strong>&gt; <strong>present </strong>&gt; <strong>share</strong> <a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/?p=124">diagram</a> as before,</p>
<p>Wolfram|alpha&#8217;s got &#8220;find&#8221; covered. More about that below.</p>
<p>It lets you access the data. If data have been used to produce a chart, then there is a query that will retrieve those bare numbers in a table format.</p>
<p>Process is perhaps Wolfram|Alpha&#8217;s forte. It will internally reformulate and cook your query to produce all meaningful outputs in its capacity.</p>
<p>The presentation is excellent. It is very legible, consistent across the site, efficient and unpretentious. When charts are provided which is often, the charts are small but both relevant and informative, only the necessary data are plotted. This is unusual enough to be worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Wolfram|alpha doesn&#8217;t allow people to share its outputs <em>per se</em>, but since a given query will produce consistent results, users can simply exchange queries or communicate links to a successful query result.</p>
<p>Now back to finding data.</p>
<p>When a user submits a query, the engine does not query external sources of data in real time. Rather, it used its internal, freebase-like database. This, in turn, is updated by external sources when possible.</p>
<p>For each query, sources are available. Unfortunately, the data sources provided are for the general categories. For instance, for all the country-related informations, the listed sources are the same, and some are accurate and dependable (national or international statistical offices), some are less reliable or verifiable (such as the CIA world factbook or what&#8217;s cited as Wolfram|Alpha curated data, 2009.). And to me that&#8217;s the big flaw of this otherwise impressive system.</p>
<p>Granted, coverage is not perfect. That can only improve. Syntax is not always intuitive &#8211; to make some results appear in a particular way can be very elusive. But this, as well, will get gradually better over time. But to be able to verify the data presented, or not, is a huge difference &#8211; either it is possible or not. I&#8217;m really looking forward to this.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left; "><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-130" title="data flow" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/data-problem2.png" alt="data flow" width="448" height="298" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">To solve any problem with data, there are 5 things you need to do in sequence. </p>
<ul>
<li>First, <strong>find </strong>the relevant data source.</li>
<li>Then, <strong>access </strong>it and get the numbers you need. </li>
<li>Then, <strong>process </strong>those numbers to make them answer your question. </li>
<li><strong>Present </strong>the results, for instance, as a data visualization, </li>
<li>and, optionally, <strong>share</strong> your analysis with your colleagues or the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to go into details here on how the last 4 steps are getting a lot of attention and dedicated tools. </p>
<p>That leaves us with finding data. </p>
<p>In many cases, finding data is a given: to work with data, you have to start from a dataset. And many researchers know for a given where the data they need are, so they only need to get them, not to find them. </p>
<p>And besides, since 2002, there&#8217;s a canned answer to every search-related question &#8211; google.</p>
<p>But the fact is, finding data <em>is </em>difficult, and, currently, google isn&#8217;t doing a great job to help. </p>
<p>Datasets are produced by subject-matter experts who describe them in their own language. If you have a loosely-defined question, its terms won&#8217;t match the scientific description of the dataset. And even if you find something, you can&#8217;t tell for sure if you found the most appropriate dataset, if it&#8217;s reliable, or find related objects &#8211; actions which are common when one is searching among objects of the same nature, like books or journal articles. </p>
<p>Publishers in those two activities adressed the problem by coming up with a standard metadata, with systems like <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/">MARC records</a> or <a href="http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a>. But that doesn&#8217;t work so well on data.</p>
<p>To address this issue, the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">oecd</span> published a white paper: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/603233448430">We Need Publishing Standards for Datasets and Data Tables</a>. (I&#8217;m credited in the end, but didn&#8217;t do much).</p>
<p>Without structured metadata standards for datasets, it&#8217;s impossible to search data across several publishers with any degree of reliability. But what a huge step that would be if an agreement could be found.</p>
