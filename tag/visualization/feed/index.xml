				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inspired by the, well, inspiring set of Lost visualizations released by Santiago Ortiz &#8211; <a href="http://intuitionanalytics.com/other/lostalgic/">Lostalgic</a>, I decided to publish the one visualization on all the data I had gathered on the Song of Ice and Fire series of books.</p>
<p><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/projects/agot/places.html"><img src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/places.png" alt="" title="places" width="600" height="448" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1484" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/projects/agot/places.html">Click to see the vis</a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the idea behind this one. Many books set in a fantasy world come with a map where all the places mentioned in the books are situated. I end up looking up these places very often to get an idea for the distances, for instance. But the way these locations are placed on a map is one specific convention. If two places are supposed to be fairly close from each other on a map but that it is very inconvenient to travel from one to the other, it is as if they were far, and conversely, if two places are a world apart but travel between them is fast and easy, it is as if they were close. </p>
<p>With that in mind I am drawing a subjective map of the Game of Thrones world.<br />
In the books, chapters are broadly comparable. Since all chapters are narrated from the point of view of one character, I link two places between which this protagonist has travelled in the course of one chapter. I also add links for travels suggested in the chapter, even if not done by the point of view character.<br />
Places which are linked are drawn one to the other. As a result, this creates an alternate, abstract geography, where distances represent the difficulties and obstacles in travel, rather than distance in the territory.</p>
<p>In addition the size of the nodes depend on the number of times they are visited in the books. A node could be large even for a relatively empty place, if a lot of the action takes place there, this is true for Castle Winterfell or Castle Black. Then again, large cities which are alluded to in the story, but where not much happens in the books, such as Casterly Rock or Sunspear, will appear as tiny dots. King&#8217;s Landing, which is the settings of roughly 25% of the books, and also probably the largest city in this world, is the largest node.</p>

<p>Noah Iliinsky and O&#8217;Reilly were kind enough to send me one review copy of Noah&#8217;s book and who says review copy says review, so here goes.</p>
<h2>We need more introductory books to data visualization.</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve had several discussions with data visualization colleagues who feel that there are too many books already. I strongly believe otherwise.</p>
<p>As of this writing, there are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/tagging/items-tagged-with?ie=UTF8&amp;flatten=1&amp;tag=data%20visualization&amp;search=1">59 books tagged data visualization</a> on Amazon, versus well over a thousand for Java (for example). And on those 59, I would say about a dozen qualify as introductory. Here are 3 reasons why introductory books are important.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You only need to know a little to start making effective visualizations. </strong>A small book won&#8217;t teach you all there is to know about visualization, but you don&#8217;t need that to get off to a good start. A lot of this has to do with asking yourself the right questions. But this is a very unnatural thing to do, especially when you feel you can do stuff. Fortunately, even a short book can help you to pause and think.</li>
<li><strong>An effective visualization is not harder to make than a poor one</strong>. Well, actually it is, really good visualizations are built after many iterations on one promising concept. But the point is, a lot of efforts and ressources can go into abyssmal visualizations. If you are in a position to buy visualization, having even basic knowledge of how data visualization works can prevent you from wasting your money.</li>
<li><strong>There are many approaches to visualization.</strong> The right introductory book will be the one that resonates with you. Some people who are interested in this love to code, some are afraid of programming. Some are accomplished visual artists, some don&#8217;t know to draw. Some have specific needs (business dashboards, presentations, interactive web applications, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 26px;"><strong>Where does designing data visualizations fit?</strong></span></h2>
<p>Designing Data Visualizations is a very short book &#8211; the advantage is that you can read this in a couple of hours. It&#8217;s perfect for a train or plane trip for instance. The format of the book (23 x 17.5 cm, flexible paperback) makes it easy to carry and read anywhere. And it&#8217;s an easy read &#8211; you won&#8217;t need to put down the book every few pages to make sure you understood.</p>
<p>The flipside of this is that you won&#8217;t learn any actionable skills from the book. The book is <strong>never trying to teach you to make things</strong> : this is explicitly outside of its scope. What is does is <strong>make you think on how to do stuff</strong>. It makes you consider the choices you make.</p>
<p>So you&#8217;re making a visualization. Does your choice of representation makes sense? how about your colors? placement? If you&#8217;re not confident that you know the answer to this kind of questions <strong>you must read the book right now</strong>; else, you won&#8217;t be able to improve your work. And again that is what successful designers do &#8211; iterate and improve, again and again and again.</p>
<p>As a non-native speaker of English one reason why I enjoy reading introductory books is for their excellent formulation of things. You know, there are those things you have a vague idea of, and the writer puts the exact words on it. So I&#8217;ll go ahead and quote my favorite paragraph :</p>
<blockquote><p>Consult [your goal] when you are about to be seduced by the siren song of circular layouts, the allure of extra data, the false prophet of &#8220;because I can&#8221;. These are distractions on your journey. As Bruce Lee would say, &#8220;It is like a finger pointing a way to the moon. Don&#8217;t concentrate on the finger or you will miss all that heavenly glory&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Who is this book for?</h3>
<p>I think the people who would benefit the most from the books fall in two categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Those who know absolutely nothing about visualization but have some interest in the subject. And the subset of those who don&#8217;t really have time to find out all about it (think: your client, your n+2 boss). They will appreciate that there is a real take-out value in such a short book.</li>
<li>Those who can create visualization because for instance they are coders, designers, excel users etc. and who see data visualization as a byproduct of their activity, so they never really asked themselves those questions. And among those, I&#8217;m thinking mostly of coders. Noah and I met at last year&#8217;s Strata conference which is also attended by the cream of the crop of the data scientists. I was surprised to see that some of them, despite being able to harness huge quantity of data, were severely limited in their visualization options because they never had an opportunity to learn. These people who are already at ease with the tool will see their activity supercharged thanks to the book.</li>
</ol>
<div>For a data practitioner who has already an interest in theory I won&#8217;t lie to you &#8211; reading the book will feel like patting yourself on the back and there will be little you will learn. But consider, for instance, giving copies to your customers and think of all the fruitless discussions that will  this will save you in the course of a project.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/?p=313">Yesterday&#8217;s post</a> on <a href="http://public.tableausoftware.com/">Tableau Public </a> generated a surge of traffic so I thought I should add more examples and practical information for people interested in the software.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick one on health, based on <a href="http://www.oecdilibrary.org/content/book/health_glance-2009-en">OECD Health at a Glance</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://publicbeta.tableausoftware.com/views/Health/Correlations"><img srcs="http://publicbeta.tableausoftware.com/static/images/Health-Correlations_rss.png" alt="click to interact" width="600" height="331" /></a></p>
<p>Just select two indicators, and you see how one influences the other. Or rather, is correlated because correlation doesn&#8217;t imply causation!</p>
<p>Here are links to more example done with Tableau Public.<br /> <a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/unesco.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-335" title="unesco" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/unesco.jpg" alt="" width="120" height="128" /></a><br /> Another Paris-based intergovernmental organisation is using Tableau &#8211; the <a href="http://www.unesco.org/en/efareport/dme/">UNESCO</a>.</p>
<p>These 2 have been done by <a href="http://www.paho.org/">PAHO</a> to describe the situation in Haiti (the 2nd is really powered by Tableau Server, but it&#8217;s close enough)<br /> <a href="http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=511&amp;Itemid=1864"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-337" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" title="HaitiPAHO1" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/HaitiPAHO1.png" alt="" width="128" height="128" /></a><a href="http://ais.paho.org/phip/viz/haiti_healthfacilities.asp"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-336" title="HaitiPAHO2" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/HaitiPAHO2.png" alt="" width="128" height="128" /></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are further examples on the<a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/blog/"> Tableau blog.</a></p>
<p>Now more about Tableau Public and the Beta.</p>
<p>Tableau Public doesn&#8217;t exactly allow you to do everything that Tableau does <em>from </em>the web. To prepare the views which are going to be published on the web, you need to use a software that runs on your computer.  It lets you do whatever you can do with the regular Tableau Desktop, with a couple of limitations: you have to stick to basic source file types (access, excel, and text file, no exotic database) and you are limited to 100,000 records of data. One other difference with the regular Tableau Desktop  is that you can&#8217;t save your work locally: you have to save it on the web, in your private space on Tableau servers. However, there are the same analytical and visual features in Tableau Public than in Tableau Desktop.</p>
<p>When your work is published, users don&#8217;t have access to all the tools you had when creating the view: they can&#8217;t move dimensions around, create exotic filters or calculations. They really see the chart as you intended it to be seen. There are a certain number of interactions built-in, however: users can select, highlight, sort and filter. If you are publishing a dashboard, the different tables and charts of the dashboard can be linked, meaning that an action (such as highlighting one dimension) in one place will be replicated elsewhere, or not. The underlying data can also be downloaded. So there is a great deal of interactivity, but not enough to twist your display beyond recognition. That being said, other Tableau Public users can download your workbook and manipulate it with the client software.</p>
<p>About the Beta: currently, Tableau Public is in closed beta. It will be in open Beta in February, as far as I know. To get a spot in the close beta, you need to write to the people of Tableau.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Those last 2 weeks, I finally found time to give Tableau 5.0. Tableau enjoys a stellar reputation among the data visualization community. About a year ago, I saw a live demo of Tableau by CEO and salesman extraordinaire Christian Chabot. Like most of the audience, I was very impressed, not so much by the capacities of the software but by the ease and speed with which insightful analysis seemed to appear out of bland data. But what does it feel on from the user perspective?</p>
<h2>Chartz: ur doing it wrong</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px; ">Everyone who wrote about charts would pretty much agree that the very first step in making one is to decide what to show. The <strong>form</strong> of the display <strong>is a consequence</strong> of this choice.</span></p>
<p>Most software got this wrong. They will ask you how you want your display to look like, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">then </span>ask you for your data. Take this screenshot from Excel:</p>
<p><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/excel.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-195" title="excel" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/excel-300x152.png" alt="excel" width="300" height="152" /></a></p>
<p>When you want to insert a chart, you must first choose what kind of chart (bar, line, column, pie, area, scatter, other charts) and one of its sub-types. You are not asked, what data does this apply to, and what that data really is. You are not asked, what you are trying to show through your chart &#8211; this is something you have to manage outside of the software. You just choose a chart.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m picking Excel because with 200m users, everyone will know what I&#8217;m talking about, but virtually all software packages ask the user to choose a rather rigid chart type as a prerequisite to seeing anything, despite overwhelming theoretic evidence that this approach is flawed. In Excel, like in many other packages, there is a world of difference between a bar chart and a column chart. They are not of the same nature.</p>
<h2>A reverted perspective</h2>
<p>Fortunately, Tableau does it the other way round. When you first connect with your data in Tableau, it distinguishes two types of variables you can play with: <strong>dimensions</strong> and <strong>measures</strong>. And measures can be continuous or discrete.</p>
<p><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/tableau-dimensions.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-196" title="tableau-dimensions" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/tableau-dimensions.png" alt="tableau-dimensions" width="649" height="576" /></a>(This is from an example file).</p>
<p>Then, all you have to do is to drag your dimensions and your measures to the center space to see stuff happening. Let&#8217;s drag &#8220;close&#8221; to the rows&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/tableau-dragging-1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-197" title="tableau-dragging-1" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/tableau-dragging-1.png" alt="tableau-dragging-1" width="649" height="576" /></a>We already see something, which is not terribly useful but still. Now if we drag Date into the columns&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/tableau-dragging-2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-198" title="tableau-dragging-2" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/tableau-dragging-2.png" alt="tableau-dragging-2" width="649" height="576" /></a></p>
<p>Instant line chart! the software found out that this is the type of representation that made the most sense in this context. You&#8217;re trying to plot continuous variables over time, so it&#8217;s pretty much a textbook answer. Let&#8217;s suppose we want another display: we can click on the aptly name &#8220;show me!&#8221; button, and:</p>
<p><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/tableau-show-me.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-199" title="tableau-show-me" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/tableau-show-me.png" alt="tableau-show-me" width="649" height="576" /></a></p>
<p>These are all the possible representations we have. Some are greyed out, because they don&#8217;t make sense in this context. For instance, you need to have dimensions with geographic attributes to plot things on a map (bottom left). But if you mouse over one of those greyed out icons, you&#8217;ll be told why you can&#8217;t use them. So we could choose anything: a table, a bar chart, etc.</p>
<p>A simple thing to do would be to switch rows and columns. What if we wanted to see date vertically and the close horizontally? Just drag and drop, and:</p>
<p><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/tableau-flip.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-200" title="tableau-flip" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/tableau-flip.png" alt="tableau-flip" width="649" height="576" /></a></p>
<h2>Crafting displays</h2>
<p>Gone are the frontiers between artificial &#8220;chart types&#8221;. We&#8217;re no longer forcing data into preset representations, rather, we assign variables (or their automatic aggregation, more on that shortly) to possible attributes of the graph. Rows and columns are two, which shouldn&#8217;t be taken too literally &#8211; in most displays, those would be better described as abcissa and ordinate &#8211; but all the areas in light grey (called &#8220;shelves&#8221;) can welcome variables : pages, filters,path, text, color, size, level of detail, etc.</p>
<p><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/more-dimensions.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-203" title="more-dimensions" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/more-dimensions.png" alt="more-dimensions" width="649" height="576" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example with a more complex dataset. Here, we&#8217;re looking at sales figures. We&#8217;re plotting profit against sales. The size of the marks correspond to the volume of the order, and the colour, to their category. Results are presented year by year. It is possible to loop through the years. So this display replicates the specs of the popular <a href="http://www.google.com/ig/directory?url=www.google.com/ig/modules/motionchart.xml">Trendalyzer / Motion chart</a> tool, only simpler to set up.</p>
<p>Note that as I drag variables to shelves, Tableau often uses an aggregation that it thinks makes more sense. For instance, as I dragged Order Date to the page shelf, Tableau picked the year part of the date. I could ask the program to use every value of the date, the display will be almost empty but there would be a screen for each day. Likewise, when I dragged Order Quantity to the Size shelf, Tableau chose to use the sum of Order Quantity instead. Not that it makes much of a difference here, as each bubble represents only one order. But the idea is that Tableau will automatically aggregate data in a way that makes sense to display, and that this can always be overridden.</p>
<p>But if I keep the data for all the years in the display, I can quickly see the transactions where profit was negative.</p>
<p><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/sets1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-205" title="sets1" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/sets1.png" alt="sets1" width="649" height="576" /></a>And I can further investigate on this set of values.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s the whole idea. Because you can assign any variable to any attribute of the visualization, in the <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/learning/examples">Tableau example gallery</a> you can see some very unusual examples of displays.</p>
<h2>Using my own data</h2>
<p>When I saw the demos, I was a little skeptical of the data being used. I mean, things were going so smoothly, evidence seemed to be jumping at the analyst, begging to be noticed. Tableau&#8217;s not bad at connecting with data of all forms and shapes, so I gave it a whirl with my own data.</p>
<p>Like a lot of other official data providers, OECD&#8217;s format of choice for exporting data is <a href="http://www.sdmx.org/">SDMX</a>, a flavor of XML. Unfortunately, Tableau can&#8217;t read that. So the next easiest thing for me was Excel.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to get too much into details, but to come up with a worksheet that Tableau liked with more than a few tidbits of data required some tweaking and some guessing. The best way seems to be: a column for each variable, dimensions and dates included, and don&#8217;t include missing data (which we usually represent by &#8220;..&#8221; or by another similar symbol).</p>
<p>Some variables weren&#8217;t automatically reckognized for what they were: some were detected as dimensions when they were measures, date data wasn&#8217;t processed that well (I found that using 01/01/2009 instead of 2009 or 1/2009 worked much better). But again, that was nothing that a little bit of tweaking couldn&#8217;t overcome.</p>
<p>On a few occasions, I have been scratching my head quite hard as I was trying to understand why I could get Y-o-Y growth rates for some variables, but not for some others, or to make custom calculated fields. Note that there are plenty of online training videos on the website. I found myself climbing the learning curve very fast (and have heard similar statements of recent users who quickly felt empowered) but am aware that practice is needed to become a Tableau Jedi. What I found recomforting is that without prior knowledge of the product, but with exposure to data design best practices, almost everything in Tableau seems logical and simple.</p>
<p>But anyway &#8211; I was in. Here&#8217;s my first Tableau dashboard:</p>
<p><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/my-dashboard.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-206" title="my-dashboard" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/my-dashboard.png" alt="my-dashboard" width="647" height="836" /></a>A Dashboard is a combination of several displays (sheets) on one space. And believe me, it can become really sophisticated, but here let&#8217;s keep it simple. The top half is a map of the world with bubbles sized after the 2007 population of OECD countries. The bottom half is the same information as a bar chart, with a twist: the colour corresponds to the population change in the last 10 years. So USA (green) have been gaining population while Hungary has seen its numbers decrease.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve created an action called &#8220;highlighting on country&#8221; to link both displays. The best feature of these actions is that they are completely optional, so if you don&#8217;t want to have linked displays, it is entirely up to you and each part of the dashboard can behave independantly. You can also bring controls to filter or animate data which I left out for the sake of simplicity. However, you can still select data points directly to highlihght them in both displays, like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/my-dashboard-highlight-bottom.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-207" title="my-dashboard-highlight-bottom" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/my-dashboard-highlight-bottom.png" alt="my-dashboard-highlight-bottom" width="647" height="836" /></a>Here I&#8217;ve highlighted the top 5 countries. The other ones are muted in both displays. Here my colour choice is unfortunate because Japan and Germany, which are selected, don&#8217;t look too different from the other countries. Now I can select the values for the countries of Europe:</p>
<p><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/my-dashboard-highlight-europe.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-208" title="my-dashboard-highlight-europe" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/my-dashboard-highlight-europe.png" alt="my-dashboard-highlight-europe" width="647" height="836" /></a></p>
<p>And you&#8217;ll see them highlighted in the bottom pane.</p>
<h2>Display and style</h2>
<p>Representing data in Tableau feels like flipping the pages of a <a href="http://www.perceptualedge.com/">Stephen Few</a> book, which is more than coincidiential as he is an advisor to Tableau. From my discussion with the Tableau consultant that called me, I take that Tableau takes pride in their sober look and feel, which fervently follows the recommendation of Tufte, and Few. I remember <a href="http://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/?p=410">a</a> <a href="http://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/?p=281">few</a> <a href="http://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/?p=266">posts</a> from Stephen&#8217;s blog where he lashed as business intelligence vendors for their vacuous pursuit of glossiness over clarity and usefulness. Speaking of Few, I&#8217;ve upgraded my Tableau trial by re-reading his previous book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596100167?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=perceedge-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0596100167">Information Dashboard Design</a>, and I could really see where his philosophy and that of Tableau clicked.</p>
<p>So there isn&#8217;t anything glossy about Tableau. Yet the interface is state-of-the-art (no more, no less). Anyone who&#8217;ve used a PC in the past 10 years can use it without much guessing. Colours of the various screen elements are carefully chosen and command placement makes sense. Most commands are accessible in contextual menus, so you really feel that you are directly manipulating data the whole time.</p>
<p>When attempting to create sophisticated dashboards, I found that it was difficult to make many elements fit on one page, as the white space surrounding all elements becomes incompressible. I tried to replicate displays that I had made or that I had seen around, I was often successful (see motion chart reproduction above) but sometimes I couldn&#8217;t achieve the level of customization that I had with visualizations which are coded from scratch in Tableau. Then again even Tableau&#8217;s simplest representations have many features and would be difficult to re-code.</p>
<h2>Sharing data</h2>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/blog/sharing-your-data-online">Dan Jewett</a>, VP of product development at Tableau,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Today it is easier to put videos on the Web than to put data online.”</p></blockquote>
<p>But my job is precisely to communicate data, so I&#8217;m quite looking forward this state of affairs to change. Tableau&#8217;s answer is twofold.</p>
<p>The first half is <strong>Tableau Server</strong>. Tableau Server is a software that organizes Tableau workbooks for a community so they can access it online, from a browser. My feeling is that Tableau Server is designed to distribute dashboards within an organization, less so with the anyone on the internet.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where the second part of the answer, <strong>Tableau Public, </strong>comes into play. Tableau Public is still in closed beta, but the principle is that users would have a free desktop applications which can do everything that Tableau Desktop does, except saving files locally. Instead, workbooks would have to be published on Tableau servers for the world to see.</p>
<p>There are already quite a few dashboards made by Tableau Public first users around. See for instance <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=X&amp;q=http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2009/08/25/how-long-does-it-take-to-build-a-technology-empire/&amp;ct=ga&amp;cd=-VD0bP-UL5I&amp;usg=AFQjCNFKCJfk02UZUVWU_JPPMM79DuAynA">How Long Does It Take To Build A Technology Empire?</a> on one of the WSJ blogs.</p>
<p>Today, there is no shortage of tools that let users embed data online without technical manipulations. But as of today, there is no product that could come close to this embedded dashboard. <a href="http://www.freakalytics.com/2009/07/06/tableau-online-available-from-my-iphone-with-interactivity-amazing/">Stephen McDaniel</a> from Freakalytics notes that due to Tableau&#8217;s technical choices (javascript instead of flash), dashboards from Tableau Public can be seen in a variety of devices, including the iPhone.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve made a few dashboards that I&#8217;d be happy to share with the world through Tableau Public.</p>
<p>This wraps up my Tableau review. I can see why the product has such an enthusiastic fan base. People such as  <a href="http://charts.jorgecamoes.com/ads-chartjunk-and-the-fart-machine/">Jorge Camoes</a>,  <a href="http://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/?p=191">Stephen Few</a>, <a href="http://eagereyes.org/blog/2009/where-are-the-visualization-tools.html">Robert Kosara</a>, <a href="http://garr.posterous.com/had-a-fantastic-time-with-the-smart-guys-from">Garr Reynolds</a>, <a href="http://www.flowingdata.com/">Nathan Yau</a>,  and even the Federal CIO <a href="http://odeo.com/episodes/24259770-Vivek-Kundra-the-Nation’s-New-CIO-Is-Supporter-of-Seattle-Startup-Tableau-Software">Vivek Kundra</a> have all professed their loved for the product. The Tableau Customer Conference, which I&#8217;ve only been able to follow online so far, seems to be more interesting each year. Beyond testimonies, the gallery of examples (again at <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/learning/examples">http://www.tableausoftware.com/learning/examples</a>, but do explore from there to see videos and white papers), still in the making, shows the incredible potential of the software.</p>
