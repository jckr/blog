				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In March this year, überscientist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram">Stephen Wolfram</a>, of <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/products/mathematica/index.html">Mathematica </a>fame, revealed the world he was working on something new, something big, something different. The first time I heard of this was through semantic web prophet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Spivack">Nova Spivack</a>, who is not known to get excited by less-than-revolutionary projects. That, plus the fact that the project was announced so short before its release, contributed to build anticipation to huge levels.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-146" title="wolframalpha" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/wolframalpha-275x300.png" alt="wolframalpha" width="275" height="300" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">Wolfram|alpha</a> describes itself as a &#8220;computational knowledge engine&#8221; or, simply put, as an &#8220;answer engine&#8221;. Like google and search engines, it tries to provide information based on a query. But while search engines simply try to retrieve the keywords of the query in their indexed pages, the answer engine tries to understand the query as a question and forms an educated answer. In a sense, this is similar to the <a href="http://www.freebase.com/">freebase</a> project, which is to put all the knowledge of a world in a database where links could be established across items.</p>
<p>It attempts to detect the nature of each of the word of the query. Is that a city? a mathematic formula? foodstuff? an economic variable? Once it understands the terms of the query, it gives the user all the data it can to answer.</p>
<p>Here for instance:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-147" title="wolframalpha-2" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/wolframalpha-2.png" alt="wolframalpha-2" width="445" height="1052" /></p>
<p>Using the same <strong>find </strong>&gt; <strong>access </strong>&gt; <strong>process </strong>&gt; <strong>present </strong>&gt; <strong>share</strong> <a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/?p=124">diagram</a> as before,</p>
<p>Wolfram|alpha&#8217;s got &#8220;find&#8221; covered. More about that below.</p>
<p>It lets you access the data. If data have been used to produce a chart, then there is a query that will retrieve those bare numbers in a table format.</p>
<p>Process is perhaps Wolfram|Alpha&#8217;s forte. It will internally reformulate and cook your query to produce all meaningful outputs in its capacity.</p>
<p>The presentation is excellent. It is very legible, consistent across the site, efficient and unpretentious. When charts are provided which is often, the charts are small but both relevant and informative, only the necessary data are plotted. This is unusual enough to be worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Wolfram|alpha doesn&#8217;t allow people to share its outputs <em>per se</em>, but since a given query will produce consistent results, users can simply exchange queries or communicate links to a successful query result.</p>
<p>Now back to finding data.</p>
<p>When a user submits a query, the engine does not query external sources of data in real time. Rather, it used its internal, freebase-like database. This, in turn, is updated by external sources when possible.</p>
<p>For each query, sources are available. Unfortunately, the data sources provided are for the general categories. For instance, for all the country-related informations, the listed sources are the same, and some are accurate and dependable (national or international statistical offices), some are less reliable or verifiable (such as the CIA world factbook or what&#8217;s cited as Wolfram|Alpha curated data, 2009.). And to me that&#8217;s the big flaw of this otherwise impressive system.</p>
<p>Granted, coverage is not perfect. That can only improve. Syntax is not always intuitive &#8211; to make some results appear in a particular way can be very elusive. But this, as well, will get gradually better over time. But to be able to verify the data presented, or not, is a huge difference &#8211; either it is possible or not. I&#8217;m really looking forward to this.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This last two weeks, three high-profile data-related services have been released: google&#8217;s public data, Wolfram|Alpha and data.gov.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;q=unemployment+rate+santa+clara&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=g1"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-137" title="google's public data" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/googlepublicdata-300x210.png" alt="google's public data" width="300" height="210" /></a><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-138" title="Wolfram|alpha" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/wolframalpha-275x300.png" alt="Wolfram|alpha" width="275" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://data.gov/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-136" title="data.gov screenshot" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/datagov-300x223.png" alt="data.gov screenshot" width="300" height="223" /></a>In the next couple of posts I&#8217;m going to review all three.</p>
<p>But before I&#8217;d like to go back to 2007, when Swivel.com and Many-eyes.com were released.</p>
<p>Those 2 services allow users to publish their own data visualizations, based on datasets uploaded by themselves or by others. At the OECD, we had used the services extensively, uploading hundreds of datasets and creating that many visualizations.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, my main gripe with both services was never the visualization proper, or the interface, or any of the services to the data publisher &#8211; which the developers knew to be highly perfectible. No, what bothered me was the navigation within the site and how all the datasets were organized. There wasn&#8217;t any way to group your datasets or visualizations, then to group these groupings. Sure, they had an author name attached to them, and later, a theme, so it was possible to see all datasets from a specific author, or about a specific theme. But at the end of the day, that was a very long list, so the top titles received all the exposure, and the others, none. And indeed, we realized that some of our data objects got all the traffic, while others, not necessarily less interesting, had none &#8211; they were simply not seen.</p>
<p>My reaction to swivel and many-eyes was to tell them, you are not going to be able to allow users to search for data sets on your site. It&#8217;s too difficult and it&#8217;s not your focus. Forget about being a community site or a portal, and instead, allow users to share what they make on your sites in the environments they like. Allow them to download images, embed applets, you name it, but the navigation will have to happen on their site, not on yours.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s see how this applies to these 3 new services.</p>
