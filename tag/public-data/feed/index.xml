				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google&#8217;s public data has been launched somewhat unexpectedly at the end of April 2009.</p>
<p>The principle is as follows. When someone enters a search query that could be interpreted as a time series, Google displays a line graph of this time series before other results. Click on it, and you can do some more things with the chart.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-142" title="googlepublicdata1" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/googlepublicdata1-300x210.png" alt="googlepublicdata1" width="450" height="315" /></p>
<p>The name public data can seem ambiguous.</p>
<p>Public, in one sense, refers to official, government-produced statistics. But, for content, public is also the opposite of copyrighted. And here, a little bit of digging reveals that it&#8217;s clearly the latter sense. If you want this service to point to your data, it must be copyright-free.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen Hans Rosling (of Gapminder fame, now Google&#8217;s data guru) deliver a few speeches to national statisticians to which he expressed all the difficulties he had to access their data, and battle with formatting or copyright issues. So I can understand where this is coming from. However. Imagine the outcry if google.com decided to stop indexing websites which were not in the public domain!</p>
<p>Remember my <strong>find </strong>&gt; <strong>access </strong>&gt; <strong>process </strong>&gt; <strong>present </strong>&gt; <strong>share</strong> <a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/?p=124">diagram</a>?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d expect that google will solve the <strong>find</strong> problem. After all, they&#8217;re search people. But they don&#8217;t! You&#8217;d find a time series if you enter its exact name in google. There is no such thing (yet, as I imagine it would be easy to fix) as a list of their datasets.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t tackle the <strong>access</strong> problem either. Once you see the visualizations, you&#8217;re not any step closer to actually getting the Â data. You can see them, point by point, by mousing over the chart. I was also disappointed by the inaccuracy of the citation of their datasets. I&#8217;d have imagined that they&#8217;d provide a direct link to their sources, but they only state which agency produced the dataset. And finding a dataset from an agency is not a trivial matter.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t deal with process, but who will hold that against them? Now what they offer is a very nice, very crisp representation of data (<strong>presenting data</strong>). I was impressed how legible the interface remained with many data series on the screen, while respecting Google&#8217;s look and feel and colour code.</p>
<p>Finally, it is also possible to <strong>share </strong>charts. Or rather, you can have a link to an image generated by google&#8217;s chart API, which is more than decent. A link to this static image, and a link to the chart on google&#8217;s public data service, and that&#8217;s all you should need (except, obviously, a link to the data proper!)</p>
<p>Another issue comes from the selection of the data sets proper.</p>
<p>One of the datasets is the unemployment rates, which are available monthly and by USA county. Now I can understand the rationale to match a google query of &#8220;unemployment rates&#8221; to that specific dataset. But there are really many unemployment rates, depending on what you divide by what. <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: mceinline;">(are we counting unemployed people? unemployed jobseekers? which definition of unemployment are we using &#8211; ILO&#8217;s, or the BLS&#8217;s? and against what is the rate calculated &#8211; total population? population of working age? total labour force?) But how could that work if you expand the system to another country? To obtain the same level of granularity (to a very narrow geographic location, to a period of a month) would require some serious cooking of the data, so you can&#8217;t have granularity, comparability and accuracy. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: mceinline;">I don&#8217;t think the system is sustainable. I don&#8217;t like the idea that it gives the impression to people that economic statistics can be measured in real time at any level, just like web usage statistics for instance. They can&#8217;t be just observed, they&#8217;re calculated by people. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: mceinline;">Google public data is still in its infancy. To have a usable list of the datasets, for instance, would alleviate much of my negarive comments on the system. But for the time being, I&#8217;m not happy with the orientation they&#8217;ve chosen.</span></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This last two weeks, three high-profile data-related services have been released: google&#8217;s public data, Wolfram|Alpha and data.gov.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;q=unemployment+rate+santa+clara&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=g1"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-137" title="google's public data" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/googlepublicdata-300x210.png" alt="google's public data" width="300" height="210" /></a><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-138" title="Wolfram|alpha" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/wolframalpha-275x300.png" alt="Wolfram|alpha" width="275" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://data.gov/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-136" title="data.gov screenshot" src="https://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/datagov-300x223.png" alt="data.gov screenshot" width="300" height="223" /></a>In the next couple of posts I&#8217;m going to review all three.</p>
<p>But before I&#8217;d like to go back to 2007, when Swivel.com and Many-eyes.com were released.</p>
<p>Those 2 services allow users to publish their own data visualizations, based on datasets uploaded by themselves or by others. At the OECD, we had used the services extensively, uploading hundreds of datasets and creating that many visualizations.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, my main gripe with both services was never the visualization proper, or the interface, or any of the services to the data publisher &#8211; which the developers knew to be highly perfectible. No, what bothered me was the navigation within the site and how all the datasets were organized. There wasn&#8217;t any way to group your datasets or visualizations, then to group these groupings. Sure, they had an author name attached to them, and later, a theme, so it was possible to see all datasets from a specific author, or about a specific theme. But at the end of the day, that was a very long list, so the top titles received all the exposure, and the others, none. And indeed, we realized that some of our data objects got all the traffic, while others, not necessarily less interesting, had none &#8211; they were simply not seen.</p>
<p>My reaction to swivel and many-eyes was to tell them, you are not going to be able to allow users to search for data sets on your site. It&#8217;s too difficult and it&#8217;s not your focus. Forget about being a community site or a portal, and instead, allow users to share what they make on your sites in the environments they like. Allow them to download images, embed applets, you name it, but the navigation will have to happen on their site, not on yours.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s see how this applies to these 3 new services.</p>
