		<description><![CDATA[when I did read the books I planned to do one (or many) visualizations but I wasn&#039;t too serious about collecting the data. So, I ended up having to scrape it from fan websites and from the body of the books which I have in text format. The text however is not super-scrape friendly with 22 different characters named Jon and 28 named Will-something, so this has been a fairly manual process. 
The most interesting dataset is the list of what happens to the characters in the chapters (who appears often, who kills whom...). I also would like to plot the evolution of the loyalty of the characters. When one crucial character flips sides, harm quickly befalls to those who trusted them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[pretty intense. did you manually collect all this data? I&#039;ve read through all the books - and to stop and analyze the travels at each chapter would be a serious endeavor!

what other plans do you have for all this data?]]></description>
