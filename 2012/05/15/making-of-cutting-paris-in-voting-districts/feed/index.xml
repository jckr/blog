		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jim, thanks
actually I&#039;m not very good at manipulating geo data (but wish I could be better). I do some geocoding now and again though so I have python scripts that can in theory lookup a bunch of addresses and spit back longitudes and latitudes. Only by the time I run them the APIs they use are deprecated or seriously limited. so for this exercise I ended up using websites with online forms to lookup a bunch of addresses in one go. I used http://www.batchgeocodeur.mapjmz.com/ which can lookup 10,000 addresses but which is quite slow and runs against google geocoder (I presume) and http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/geocoder/ which can process 1,000 addresses and uses yahoo&#039;s. I actually looked up the missing addresses or the ones that were apparently incorrect on google map and manually entered more reliable points. I have been living for about 15 years in Paris so it was time I put that knowledge to good use :) Though, I have discovered that Paris has a &quot;rue Python&quot;. no word on a javascript avenue though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great writeup! - and really great insights on how you tackled this interesting problem.

Could I ask what geocoding service you were using for this?
And, did you use a GIS tool to do the manual correction - like qQis?]]></description>
