		<description><![CDATA[HI, 
I tried your quick iframe hack and it worked! For the newbies out there (like me) there&#039;s one caveat, you need to install the iframes plug-in if your site is a Wordpress.org blog. Once you install the plug-in, just copy and paste Jerome&#039;s code and replace with your own URL. 
I also found that if you set the dashboard size to &quot;automatic&quot; it might not resize properly according to your site&#039;s layout. If you don&#039;t want to bother using fixed width and height measures, theres an option in Tableau 8.2 to size the dashboard or story at &quot;medium/large&quot; blog size. This worked perfect for me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Jerome.  Great post!  I like the thorough explanation of each line of code.  It helps a beginner like me learn and not just copy/paste. I&#039;m having the same problem as the user above.  Still trying to research a way to get this to work.  You can see what I&#039;ve done over at my wordpress blog: https://dimeler.wordpress.com/ .

If you take a look at my post, I&#039;m having the same issue when I post the Tableau Public viz code where there‚Äôs a ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù sign in the middle of it which does nothing when you click on it.  When I try your iframe code, I get the same thing where there&#039;s just a link to my Tableau Public workbook.  I understand this is an older blog post, but any insight would be greatly appreciated!  Looking forward to your response.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I tried your iframe code and the only thing appearing is the hyperlink to my data stuff at Tableau website. I expected the actual graph to appear and being interactive.

But also, if I copy the long code provided by Tableau Public the graph on my webpage is static (not interactive), there&#039;s a &quot;Play&quot; sign in the middle of it which does nothing when you click on it and, finally, the graph overlaps on the following text (I place my graph between two paragraphs).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jerome - thanks for the solution.  As I relatively new to this (trying to embed Tableau vix into Wordpress) ,  could you show me the iframe solution above, as it fits into the whole body of the embedding code?

Thank you in advance]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[the best part is that In tableau, when creating dashboards, I have always used the option to size them exactly at a precise size and I recommend you do that too. Then add 2-6 px to each dimension and use that as width and height.
thanks
