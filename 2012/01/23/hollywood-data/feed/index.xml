		<description><![CDATA[oh yes. I gave many caveats emptors in the post. The main problem is that keywords are not universally attributed. Also, more popular movies tend to be better described (ie with more keywords) so that the value of each keyword is artifically high. Also, as you point out, the ratio of parameters / observation is ridiculously high so overfitting is a certainty (even if the regression is regularized). 
however I think that it&#039;s possible to get some meaningful results by watching whether a few  features are present in a large number of movies.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a neat idea, but you&#039;re estimating an awful lot of parameters with your regression here, which is a dangerous thing to do unless you&#039;re careful to avoid over-fitting. Which of these effects are statistically significant and how do we know we&#039;re not just looking at noise for the parameter estimates for a lot of these keywords? Maybe worth doing some feature selection here, or at least giving p-values or confidence intervals...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[one question: i look at the IMDB keyword search page, but i can&#039;t figure out how you were able to query it based on keyword count, or movie titles in order to join it back to the original dataset. did you write some sort of scraper for their website?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[thanks for your good wishes!
what we have done has nothing to do with this (except: explosions). Doing something with keywords was my original idea, but Jen came up with something better and so we move in that direction. 
Good luck to you too!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very interesting stuff. I&#039;m excited to see what you guys come up with for the challenge. I have my own submission, but it sounds like its going to get blown out of the water by more creative entries. 

Would also be interested in finding out a bit more of the process behind how you and Jen designed and split up the implementation. And how long the total project took.

Good luck!]]></description>
