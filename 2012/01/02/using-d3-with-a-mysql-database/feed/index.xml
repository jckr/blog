		<description><![CDATA[Also Jerome, with most if the custom slippy map libraries e.g. Leaflet.js, polymaps etc. you can get the bounds of the visible map region and fire an ajax request for new data for the region/tile each time a drag happens. This means you should be able to only load the data points you need for your geo-spatial map on demand. Shoot me a mail if you need some code samples closer to the date.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ben, thanks for the tip, especially since I&#039;m considering doing this type of map some time soon, the dataset I&#039;m looking at has 450k entries so loading them all in memory just won&#039;t do... 
re the other problem, I hadn&#039;t tried this, since the data file was generated with python I tried using pickle but the size gains were really minimal. I&#039;ll see if it helps!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jerome, 

This is probably a bit advanced from where you are at the moment, but it would be worth looking at Backbone.js as a pseudo MVC framework to handle updates to data and subsequent rendering of views in Html and D3. 

A simple example of where such a framework may start to be useful is in a long lived polling/websocket for social media visualisations. 

Slippy map style visualisations are another area where data updates based on drags and subsequent bounds setting would be useful.

Also - In terms of size of data payload that was mentioned in the google groups for data, if you can configure it on your web server, you could gzip the data files and push them back to the client that way thus reducing data sent.

		<description><![CDATA[Jerome -

Very interesting, and look forward to experimenting with MySQL connections to d3. The d3 charts are exceptional, but static data makes for a lot of work to create multiple visualizations.

Thanks for your work!]]></description>
