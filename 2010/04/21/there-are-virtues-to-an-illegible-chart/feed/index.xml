		<description><![CDATA[well, the original pie sure could have been sleeker. I would never have made it like this, probably because I never would have used a pie chart to begin with. And if I was commissioned to make one, I would have done exactly as you say.

I appreciate that some people are not trying to inform with an objective, orthodox chart, but are rather trying to convince with charts which are formally questionable (yet error-free), but which are effective.
it reminds of the road to recovery chart from the Obama administration. (http://flowingdata.com/2010/02/17/road-to-recovery-is-the-recovery-act-working/). I can find a million reasons why this chart is flawed (well, at least a couple) but I think it&#039;s effective as a communication tool.

All in all I think people will be able to make stronger points if they use data, and it&#039;s great to see that some people are able to come up with different ways of doing it which we &quot;chart people&quot; would not even dare to consider.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting point, but I still think it&#039;s a bad chart (the pie chart, that is). Having all the labels plot over each other does not look like a deliberate decision, but rather looks careless and lazy.

You&#039;re right of course that not every data point has to be shown, especially when the goal is to make a point rather than to provide the data for the reader to explore. And in such a simple chart, it&#039;s not really possible to show that much data, anyway.

To really make a point, they could have shown the three or four largest slices and then combined the rest into an &quot;Other&quot; slice labeled with the number of countries represented in there. Or maybe put the entire list of countries next to that slice. Each of these would have made the point, and would have been a clear decision rather than the trainwreck this chart is.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You bring up an interesting point on the pie chart; that the illegible labels can in fact be seen as a key part of the visualization, being used to prove the graphic&#039;s point. While the pie is not useful for consuming the data, it does provide a pretty clear message. 

The relationship between data, art, bias/motive and other factors is becoming a very hot topic in dataviz and a fun one to discuss. There&#039;s quite a range of visualizations between Napoleon&#039;s march (http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/posters) and the stock market mountains (http://infosthetics.com/archives/2010/03/high_altitude_the_stock_market_trends_as_realistic_mountain_ranges.html), and it&#039;s interesting to see how they&#039;re all received and interpreted.

great post and examples.]]></description>
