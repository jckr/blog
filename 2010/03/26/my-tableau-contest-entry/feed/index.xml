		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for explaining your through process and for providing some context for this data.  The fact that other countries have much lower obesity rates is very interesting.  Adding this as a comment would emphasize this much better than adjusting the scale for coloring the marks.  Adjusting the color range makes sense if the US graph appears as part of a comparison to other countries, but since this graph stands on its own it makes good sense for the color scale to reflect the true range of values in the data set.  Besides, it affords the reader the opportunity to ask questions such as &quot;is 12.5% really the lowest obesity rate in the US?&quot;  Just a thought :)]]></description>
