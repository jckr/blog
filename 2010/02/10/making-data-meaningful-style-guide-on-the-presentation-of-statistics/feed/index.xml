		<description><![CDATA[Stephen Few&#039;s book I was thinking of when I wrote this, &quot;show me the numbers&quot;, is 267 pages, all written from the same point of view, his. 
Making data meaningful is 52 pages which are sometimes the fruit of consensus and numerous edits. 
So, his version is more complete. 
In my contribution I tried to approach the problem from another angle. I&#039;m recommending chart designers to be aware of the visual efforts that their creations require, and to adjust that effort to the purpose required: when you want to make something obvious, make it easy to decipher, when you want the reader to ignore some fact, represent it in a less comprehensible way. 
After the many edits though, I&#039;m not sure this point is really represented in the final manuscript.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jerome,

I wonder why you recommend to buy Stephen Few&#039;s book. It sounds like you prefer that book over the style guide to which you have contributed yourself. Is your preference related to the content, the writing style or perhaps something else?

Thanks for putting this on your blog anyway.

		<description><![CDATA[Jerome,

Somehow the link for Part 1  does not resolve.  Do you have another link for it.  

BTW, you know I really enjoy your work and your insight / innate sense of what makes a good and useful data visualization.

MANY BLESSINGS!
Peace and All Good!
