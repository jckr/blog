	<section class="post-content">

		<p>So Jen and I released our <a href="http://bit.ly/starchallenge">Info+beauty awards entry</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/starchallenge"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1205" title="shootingstars" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/shootingstars.png" alt="" width="628" height="636" /></a></p>
<p>How did we end up with this?</p>
<p>it&#8217;s really cool working around movies, because it&#8217;s something we can relate to.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1206" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/20120203_105750.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1206" title="20120203_105750" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/20120203_105750.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A part of my movie ticket stubs stash.</p></div></p>
<p>At first I wanted to do something out of keywords we could grab on the movies but  Jen came up with another idea I found more worth pursuing: working around the story types (which was the most interesting aspect of the curated contest dataset) and see if there was not some kind of grand truth we could unravel there. She also requested stars and glitter, because we were not going to work on this glamorous dataset with a tedious dashboard done in Excel.</p>
<p>That truth didn&#8217;t take so much time to find: the most frequently used story types (like comedy or movies with monsters) do not perform well in the box office while different story types (stories of teens growing up, or when the main character turns into something else), which are used less often, are much more profitable. So why doesn&#8217;t hollywood make more Junos and Black Swans and fewer College Road Trips or Dylan Dogs?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the idea. Now the making.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Fair warning &#8211; the rest of this post is fairly technical. </span></p>
<h3>Making stars</h3>
<p>If I had to contribute significantly to the project it had to be done in d3/svg.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it&#8217;s easy to generate star shapes in d3. Once you have the coordinates of where the points of one unitary star should be, you can easily make stars of any size with a function and a parameter.</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">
var c1=Math.cos(.2*Math.PI),c2=Math.cos(.4*Math.PI),
    s1=Math.sin(.2*Math.PI),s2=Math.sin(.4*Math.PI),
    r=1,

    // ok the constant after r1 is the thickness of the branches.
    // 1 is a &quot;straight&quot; star, less is narrower, more is thicker.

    r1=1.5*r*c2/c1,
    star=[
        [0,-r],
        [r1*s1,-r1*c1],
        [r*s2,-r*c2],
        [r1*s2,r1*c2],
        [r*s1,r*c1],
        [0,r1],
        [-r*s1,r*c1],
        [-r1*s2,r1*c2],
        [-r*s2,-r*c2],
        [-r1*s1,-r1*c1],
        [0,-r]
        ];
    // this is a list of the pair of coordinates of the points that make a star.
lineStar=function(k) {
	var line=d3.svg.line()
		.x(function(d) {return d[0]*k;})
		.y(function(d) {return d[1]*k;})
	return line(star)+&quot;Z&quot;; // this will stitch everything together.
}</pre>
<p>Now, running lineStar(10) will return the path description of a star with a radius of 10, thusly:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">&quot;M0,-10L3.367709824346891,-4.635254915624212L9.510565162951535,-3.0901699437494745L5.449068960040206,

8.090169943749475L-5.449068960040206,1.770509831248423L-9.510565162951535,-3.0901699437494745
L-3.367709824346891,-4.635254915624212L0,-10Z&quot;</pre>
<h3>Placing, moving (and spinning) the stars</h3>
<p>The next idea was placing the stars.</p>
<p>And for this we need two things: being able to position them somewhere, and being able to move them easily from point A to point B, ideally with some cool effect in between.</p>
<p>So, it would be possible to change the x and y attributes of the path, but each would have to be dealt with separately with a different function call. I found it a better approach to rely on the <strong>transform </strong>attribute and <strong>translate</strong>. Each time I want to position a star somewhere, I need it to be set at an x and y coordinate, which will always correspond to either the data of the star, or that of a group above it. For instance, a star corresponding to a movie will need to be at the position corresponding to the data of that movie, or that of the story type above it if it&#8217;s still collapsed, or that of the high-level grouping of story types if that&#8217;s collapsed.</p>
<p>Now all of the data structures for that are array of objects which all have x and y keys. In other terms, for any star-shaped object, I can always expect the underlying datum d to have d.x and d.y values. So, I wrote a function <strong>translate(d)</strong> which works on those 2 properties. And as a result, when I need to position any object all I have to write is:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">.attr(&quot;transform&quot;,translate)</pre>
<p>and the object will be positioned according to its underlying data. (this is equivalent to writing .attr(&#8220;transform&#8221;,function(d) {return translate(d);}) )</p>
<p>If I need to be them elsewhere, i.e. at the position of their parent, I can pass the data of that parent as an argument, for instance:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">.attr(&quot;transform&quot;,function(d) {return translate(structs[d.struct]);})</pre>
<p>For a cheap bit of extra action, I&#8217;ve added a spinning effect in the translate function. Since translate(d) returns a value for the transform attribute, nobody said it just had to be instructions for translation! so I&#8217;ve added a rotate after the translate. The arguments for the rotate function depend on the x and y properties of the argument as well, so when stars move across the screen, the rotate angle changes slightly with each increment of either coordinate, giving the impression of spinning.</p>
<h3>Explosions, starlets and other effects</h3>
<p>Most of the cool things happening in the visualization rely on one very simple principle about d3 transitions: <strong>chaining them. </strong><br />
In the code you&#8217;ll find oftentimes this pattern:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">.selectAll(&quot;someobject&quot;).data(...).enter().append(...) // creates the items
... // sets the initial attributes
...
.transition()
... // change the attributes
...
...
...
.each(&quot;end&quot;, function() { // stuff to be done on each item after the transition is over
</pre>
<p>and within that function, you&#8217;ll find either:<br />
another transition which starts exactly when the previous one ends, so for instance opacity can decrease (causing a fading effect): d3.select(this).transition()&#8230;</p>
<p>or a command to remove the object: d3.select(this).remove().</p>
<p>When another transition is called, there can be another one after, then another one, then another one, then eventually the object can be removed (or not).</p>
<p>Now you may think of transitions as ways to get one object to change smoothly from state A to state B, like a rectangle moving across the screen. But if you start to think that the <strong>objects can be discarded after the transitions</strong>, you&#8217;ll realize that there is an unbelievable number of things that can be done with them.<br />
For instance, upon clicking on some stars, I am creating another star shape at that same location. Initially it has a the same size as the star, but I increase that radius to a large number (1000px) while decreasing its opacity to 0. So it seems that the new star is both exploding and fading. When it&#8217;s become transparent I remove it.</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">gStructs.append(&quot;svg:path&quot;) // here I'm creating a &quot;path&quot; shape
.style(&quot;stroke&quot;,&quot;none&quot;) // with no outline
.style(&quot;fill&quot;,colorXp)  // with the fill color of the explosion
.style(&quot;opacity&quot;,0.2)  // and a low opacity to start with (translucent)
.attr(&quot;d&quot;,lineStar(d.size[sizeAxis])) // I give it the shape of a star and the size of the
                                      // star that's being clicked
.attr(&quot;transform&quot;,translate(d)) // and I position it on that star

.transition() // action!

.duration(500)	// a 500ms transition. Long enough to see the effect.
.attr(&quot;d&quot;,lineStar(1000)) // the star expands to a radius of 1000.
.style(&quot;opacity&quot;,0) // while fading to transparency.

.each(&quot;end&quot;,function() {d3.select(this).remove();}) // and when it's done - it's removed.
</pre>
<h3>Changing axes</h3>
<p>In this visualization I let the user change what&#8217;s plotted along the axes. It&#8217;s not very difficult to do but it&#8217;s a hassle to do it late in the project as it has been our case because it requires a lot of housekeeping. This is really about the data structures that will support our items. Instead of having just one value for x, y and size they have an object with several keys, one per axis. Then we maintain one variable per axis type, so everywhere we should write: d.x, we write instead: d.x[xAxis].</p>
<p>So when there is an axis change, of course, we do a transition so that the stars and everything move smoothly to their new position. But what if the objects were already moving? When an unplanned transition interferes with an ongoing one, the results are often ugly, especially if the current transition had chained transitions waiting to be triggered. In other words, this will leave a mess.</p>
<p>The way I&#8217;ve dealt with this is by keeping a tab on the number of transitions going on at a certain time. The axis change could only occur if no other transitions were taken place. If that was the case they were simply denied. There are other ways to do that like a queue of actions but that seemed the simple and adequate way to deal with this.</p>
<h3>Bootstrap and google fonts</h3>
<p>This was the first non-trivial project where I used <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">bootstrap</a> and I&#8217;m just never going back. Bootstrap simply removes all the hassle of arranging all the elements of a visualization on a screen and is very easy to use. Plus, it comes up with sensible options for buttons, forms, and the like. Since the contest it has evolved faster than a pokémon, for instance it is now possible to specify custom colors in a form and bootstrap will generate the appropriate css files. <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts">Google fonts</a> are another great help as they are a very easy solution to choose fonts among a relatively large number of choices without relying on the fact that all the users have these fonts on their computer.</p>
<h3>Wrapping it up</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of other hacks in the code which you are welcome to explore, I admit I don&#8217;t remember them all because I took too much time to write this blog post after creating the entry (bad). However if there is one point you would like be to explain please ask in the comments.<br />
I&#8217;m not entirely sure of what happened when I submitted the entry though. First it wasn&#8217;t listed with the others, then I got a message saying it hadn&#8217;t been reviewed, so it didn&#8217;t win anything, yet some time after the prizes have been handled it appeared in the &#8220;shortlisted&#8221; visualizations for the contest (which I found by accident). So whether or not it was good, I let you guys judge, at any rate it was fun making.</p>

		<p>a couple of days ago I posted the <a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-admin/post.php?post=1185&amp;action=edit">contribution of relative keywords to the earnings of a given movie</a>.</p>
<p>Well, it occurs that the cast of a movie is much easier to obtain than keywords and much less messy. So, I also had scraped the 4 lead actors for each movie of the <a href="/category/data-visualization/page/4/www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/2012/01/challenge-of-the-stars/">Beautiful Information awards</a> in order to determine their contribution.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done it slightly differently than with the keywords. I&#8217;ve also taken the budget of the movie into account. So, in order to predict the earnings of a movie, you take the budget, multiply it by 3, remove 8 millions and then add (or remove) the contribution of each star.</p>
<p>Since the movie budget already (mostly 🙂 ) includes the pay of the lead actors, the way to read this contribution is <strong>how much extra these actor should be paid when they appear on film</strong>. For instance, each time Emma Stone does her thing, it would be fair to pay her $500k more.</p>

<p>Likewise, Kirsten Dunst here could be paid an extra 200k per movie, like Rebecca Hall or Rooney Mara. But I mostly felt like posting a picture of Kirsten to stand up against what google autosuggests as keywords when you look her up.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1198" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/kirsten.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1198" title="kirsten" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/kirsten.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kirsten, too, should be paid more.</p></div></p>
<p><a href="http://gifolascage.tumblr.com/">Nicolas Cage</a>, somewhat unsurprisingly,  should refund $2.44m for each movie he stars in.</p>
<p>Actors of movies who&#8217;ve done exceedingly well such as Avatar or the Harry Potter or Twilight sagas, movies which, it&#8217;s fair to say, owe their success to more than the actors, come out of this over valued. And because of how this is calculated, actors who have costarred with them in less ambitious movies come out undervalued: for instance, Elizabeth Banks or Anton Yelchin who both played with Sam Worthington are &#8220;paying&#8221; the fact that Man on the Ledge or Terminator: Renaissance haven&#8217;t been as successful as Avatar.</p>
<p>Twilight fans take note, though, that Harry Potter actors are considered more valuable.</p>
<p>Now &#8211; the data.</p>

		<p>Ever heard of the <a href="http://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/">Information is Beautiful awards</a>? It&#8217;s visualization competitions a monthly visualization competition put together by David McCandless of Information is Beautiful fame.</p>
<p>Part of it are monthly competitions that run on a curated dataset. <a href="http://www.datatelling.com/">Jen Lowe</a> and I are making a team for the current one <a href="http://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/2012/01/challenge-of-the-stars/">about the movie industry</a> and we are going to deliver a competitive entry! even our drafts are rocking! But, while we were looking for that one great idea I explored the data.</p>
<p>Part of the dataset is the total box office earnings of over 600 of the movies released in the US in the last 5 years. What I did is cross that list with the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Sections/Keywords/">user-contributed plot keywords</a> on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">imdb</a>. Then, I ran a regression on that to find out <strong>how much each keyword would generate in the box office? </strong>(I only kept those keywords mentioned over 5 times, that&#8217;s just over 2500, because else the full list is  20,000+). The full list is at the end of the article.</p>

	<section class="post-content">

		<p>At the recent VisWeek conference, Jessica Hullman and her coauthors presented &#8220;<a href="http://www.cond.org/difficulties.pdf">Benefitting Infovis with Visual Difficulties</a> (pdf)&#8221;, a paper that suggests that the charts which are read almost effortlessly are not necessarily the ones that readers understand or remember best. To answer that claim, Stephen Few wrote <a href="http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/visual_difficulties.pdf">a rather harsh critique of this paper</a> (pdf). As I read this I felt the original paper was not always fairly represented, but more importantly, that the views develop by both parties are not at all inreconcilable. Let me explain.</p>
<h2>What is cognitive efficiency, or &#8220;say it with bar charts&#8221;</h2>
<p>For quite some time, we were told that to better communicate with data, we had to make visuals as clear as possible.</p>
<p>The more complicated way of saying that is talking of &#8220;cognitive efficiency&#8221;. By reducing the number of tasks needed to understand a chart and simplifying them, which is sometimes called reducing the &#8220;cognitive cost&#8221; or &#8220;cognitive load&#8221;, we improve all virtues of the chart.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1115" style="width: 683px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/frompietobar.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1115" title="frompietobar" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/frompietobar.png" alt="Various charts based on the same data points, shown in order of cognitive cost" width="673" height="142" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Various charts based on the same data points. From left to right, they make the task of comparing individuals value increasingly easier</p></div></p>
<p>For instance: bar charts are easier to process than pie charts, because it&#8217;s easier for the human eye to compare lengths than angles. So, with equivalent data, bar charts have a lower cognitive cost than pie charts. Likewise, bar charts which are ordered by value (smallest bars to largest bars) are easier to read than unordered ones. Ordered bar charts have an even lower cognitive cost than unordered ones.</p>
<p>Conversely, adding non-data elements add extra tasks for the reader and increase cognitive cost. These non-data elements have been reviled by Edward Tufte as &#8220;chartjunk&#8221;. His data-ink theory says that out of all the ink used for the chart, as much as possible should be devoted to data elements. Again, this goes in the direction of data efficiency.</p>
<h2>Engagement rather than immediacy?</h2>
<p>Again for quite some times those rules were held to be universal. Yet, several tried to challenge them, the latest being Jessica Hullman in her paper &#8220;<a href="http://www.cond.org/difficulties.pdf">Benefitting Infovis with Visual Difficulties</a>&#8220;. This paper was so thought-provoking that it received an honorable mention at the recent IEEE Information Visualization Conference 2011 (as a note to the non-academic reader, this is quite a competitive achievement).</p>
<p>New information visualisation techniques are often <strong>evaluated</strong>.  This paper argues that such evaluations typically consider response time or accuracy, and not how well users are able to interpret and remember visuals. When only the former criteria are taken into account then cognitive efficiency is the superior framework. But this is not the case of data storytelling (which is, arguably, a small subset of  all data visualizations).</p>
<p>When visualizations attempt to transmit a message, then how well users can receive this message, as well their capacity to remember this for a long time are of utmost importance, much more than the ease with which a visualization is read.</p>
<p>In that case, Jessica Hullman proposes a trade-off between cognitive efficiency and &#8220;obstructions&#8221;. The idea is that such obstructions, or <strong>visual difficulties, can trigger active learning processes</strong>. In other words, if when trying to read a chart, a user doesn&#8217;t understand it effortlessly, but is somehow willing to get to the bottom of it, she will apply all her active brainpower to it. This effort surge will lead her to not only better interpret it but also to better remember it. To sum up, these obstructions can have positive effects, this is why when this effect works, they are called <em>desirable difficulties</em>.</p>
<p>Desirable difficulties are tricky, because if the &#8220;obstruction&#8221; is too large, if a small additional effort is not enough to understand the chart, then it will not work. So, this is definitely not about maximizing the difficulty to understand the visualizations.</p>
<p>In the recommendations parts of the paper the authors say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Instead of minimizing the steps required to process visualization, induce <strong>constructive</strong>, self-directed, cognitive activity on the part of the user.</p></blockquote>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean that anything goes. This paper does not argue to add as many difficulties as possible, to use every gratuitous effect in the book. Instead, the paper goes on to give actionable design suggestions to enhance reader stimulation and active information processing.</p>
<p><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/bli.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-880" title="bli" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/bli.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/blog/2011/05/25/better-life-index-a-post-mortem/">In my practice,</a> for instance with the <a href="http://oe.cd/bli">Better Life Index</a>, I verify the analyses of the Hullman paper: the novelty of the form and the aesthetic appeal of the representation drive the users to overcome the difficulty posed by the unusual shape of the flower/glyph. Would bar charts have conveyed the data more efficiently and more accurately? Definitely! would the user engagement have been comparable? Definitely not.</p>
<h1>A critique by Stephen Few</h1>
<p>Stephen Few, whose work I have praised at multiple occasions in this blog, has published a <a href="http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/visual_difficulties.pdf">critique of this paper</a> (pdf). Reading his article, then the paper again, I had the feeling that they didn&#8217;t talk about the same things. In certain contexts, difficulties are not desirable at all and must be eradicated. Yet, in other contexts, cognitive efficiency does not provide the  optimal solution.</p>
<p>For instance, Stephen writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Long-term recall is rarely the purpose of information visualization.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fair enough! so let&#8217;s agree that when it is not the case, we should not trouble ourselves with seeking to add obstructions to the display. For instance: business intelligence systems, dashboards (for monitoring), visual analytics (and more on this shortly). Spreadsheets, mostly. All usages of data that support decision, and most usages in the corporate world. The Hullman paper only applies in the other cases anyway.</p>
<p>He would also write (emphasis by me):</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Skilled data analysts</strong> learn to view data from many perspectives to prevent knee-jerk conclusions based on inappropriate heuristics.</p></blockquote>
<p>Agreed! and by all means, let them analyse and let them view data from as many perspectives as they see fit, and don&#8217;t get in the way of their job.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1116" style="width: 815px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/palantir-fraud.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1116" title="palantir-fraud" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/palantir-fraud.png" alt="" width="805" height="605" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">For context, check out www.palantirtech.com/government/analysis-blog/mortgage-fraud</p></div></p>
<p>This here is taken from a demo from Palantir government. Here analysts are tracking mortgage fraud. Each yellow dot on the top display is a transaction where a house has been sold for over 200% of its purchase value, and the ones which are connected are about the same house. We can immediately see 2 suspicious clusters where a property has been resold 4 times in these conditions. And if at the end of their work day the analysts don&#8217;t remember the address of the fraudulent transaction, it&#8217;s no big deal as long as they have identified a wrong practice.</p>
<p>Conversely, at the risk of repetition, the paper authors write of a trade-off between efficiency and obstructions &#8211; cognitive efficiency being generally positive. They say that obstructions become desirable difficulties only if they are <em>constructive, </em>that is if they are able to trigger active information processing. They are <strong>not </strong>championning 3D pie charts or atrocious dashboards as the one at the end of Stephen&#8217;s article.  Jessica signals that novelty enhance active information processing. I don&#8217;t know how to characterize speed dials in dashboards, for instance, but novel would not be the word I&#8217;d use, and again they wouldn&#8217;t be favoured by the authors of the paper. So, I think it&#8217;s a bit unfair to associate the paper with the terrible, terrible visuals presented in Stephen&#8217;s article, the ones in the original paper being a little bit more defendable.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1119" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/mortgage-delinquency.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1119" title="mortgage-delinquency" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/mortgage-delinquency.png" alt="" width="600" height="283" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">To see this chart in context see http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/41/50/47984536.pdf</p></div></p>
<p>Consider this other chart (and let&#8217;s assume for the sake of discussion that its cognitive cost is low, while it could be much lower by showing fewer time series for instance). This was published in an OECD publication almost 2 years before the 2008 crisis. I would say this chart is easy to read (we see mortgage delinquency rates dropping in most countries) but difficult to interpret and to recall. Like other charts of the document, this one is an oracle of financial apocalypse, as the proportion of delinquent mortgage in the US, the only one without a downward trend, will have the consequences that we know. So if a different way of showing the same data could have made that more obvious at the cost of legibility, I think it would have been worth a shot.</p>
<h2>Are we on common ground yet?</h2>
<p>If not, let&#8217;s assume now that there exists visualizations where long-term recall is, indeed, the main purpose. Examples would include use in journalism, politics, advocacy, marketing&#8230; Jessica has been involved in the series of workshop <a href="http://data-stories.com/">Telling stories with data</a> at VisWeek. This suggests an interesting distinction.</p>
<ul>
<li>visualizations which are tools with which a user accesses or manipulates data.</li>
<li>visualizations where an author, with a specific intent, tries to frame data in a certain way to an audience. In that case, the author wants to make sure the audience receives the message as intended, and remembers it.</li>
</ul>
<div>See where I&#8217;m going?</div>
<div>In the <strong>first</strong> case, we want <strong>cognitive efficiency</strong> all the way.</div>
<div>In the <strong>second</strong>, we are mostly concerned with <strong>getting our message across</strong> and <strong>making it stick</strong>.</div>
<div>So, <strong>there is no contradiction</strong> between having a set of rules for one category of visuals, and a different one for the other, especially since the criteria of success are so different. To illustrate this I note that both the article and the paper refer to Tableau, a &#8220;cognitive efficiency&#8221; company. Yet, it turns out that Tableau is also very interested in doing as well as possible in the story telling front, and that questions asked at the paper&#8217;s presentation by Tableau representatives show their interest in this research.</div>
<h2>Where to from there?</h2>
<div>We have proven methods to reduce the cognitive cost of a visual, and we can thank Stephen Few for making them more accessible. It&#8217;s much more difficult, though, to optimize the characteristics of a successful &#8220;data narrative&#8221;, that is interpretation and memorability. It&#8217;s an infographics jungle out there. Those of us who haven&#8217;t seen their share of undefendable visuals just haven&#8217;t searched enough, but absolutely anything goes.</div>
<div>We still do not have an equivalent framework for visualizations that tell stories. InfoVis started to study them (such as in the remarkable <a href="http://vis.stanford.edu/papers/narrative">Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories With Data</a>) and characterize them, but we don&#8217;t have a systematic, reproducible way to make sure that data narrative will work well, just as we can do the perfect dashboard.  We do know that the best examples at large do not comply with the rules of cognitive efficiency though. Fortunately, practitioners have not waited for convincing resarch and are leading the way, even though many get lost in the process. This is why we need more research on that front! I for one is looking forward new developments in this area of InfoVis.</div>

    </header>
	<section class="post-content">

		<p>Normally, at this time of the year, I&#8217;ll be writing a recap of VisWeek. And I will &#8211; the writeups I have been doing for<a href="http://www.visualisingdata.com/"> visualisingdata.com</a> were just highlights of individual talks. But much of my VisWeek 2011 experience happened in between the talks. People you meet, ideas you glimpse, that collide and generate new ideas, plans you make&#8230;</p>
<p>One person I am always happy to meet at VisWeek, and who is visible from afar, is Tableau&#8217;s Jock MacKinlay. Since I couldn&#8217;t attend TCC11, I spent some time talking with Jock and Lori Williams about 7 and plans for the future. Whenever I would start a sentence by &#8220;hmm, you know&#8230;&#8221; Lori or Jock would write it down and ask me to send any remark in writing, so I thought I should do that, but rather than keeping this private, I&#8217;m going to stick to what&#8217;s written on one button I picked up on their stand: do it in public.</p>
<p>For a piece of software that complex, Tableau Desktop/Public has received improvements at an astonishing rate. So fast that one of the recommendations I had is already implemented or ready in the next release. So I have the conviction that Tableau product people care and are on the lookout for useful suggestions on how to move forward. Here are a few.</p>
<h2>On design</h2>
<h3>More fonts please!</h3>
<p>In Tableau Public, you&#8217;re stuck with the windows XP default fonts. That&#8217;s not an awful lot. Is that enough?</p>
<p>For the first 15 years or so of the web, webmasters had to be content with so called web-safe fonts. There was a time where the web was probably 90% verdana and people accepted this like death and taxes. But this is now 2011 and any personal website can be a marvel of customized typography &#8211; at least, the parts around a Tableau viz.</p>
<p>More specifically there are two issues with the current set of fonts.</p>
<p>First, there is no condensed font (think Helvetica Condensed, etc.). But condensed fonts are extremely useful to display numbers in callouts or on axes.</p>
<p>Second, the default font is Arial. This is not a neutral choice. There are lots of adjectives that can be associated with Arial, and frankly I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s right these qualifiers should apply to Tableau. Arial is the default font of Excel pre-2007 , it&#8217;s the font of those bullet-ridden, unstyled, unsavory powerpoint slides that bore us to death for over a decade of unnecessary meetings. Many say it&#8217;s a rip-off of Helvetica.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1082" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/crazy_stupid_love/quotes/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1082" title="crazy-stupid-love-ryan-gosling-steve-carell" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/crazy-stupid-love-ryan-gosling-steve-carell.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="387" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tableau, you&#39;re better than Arial. Say it.</p></div></p>
<p>Being able to chose one&#8217;s font is essential to branding. The typography of my vizzes should concord with that of my website and my brand. Same goes with my colours (more on that in a second). Conversely if any output on my website is not aligned with my brand it denotes a lack of control.</p>
<h3>So what should Tableau do?</h3>
<p>Offer more fonts! There are literally hundreds of proven fonts which would be very well suited for dashboards. Fonts which are not unheard of, yet not trite. Legible, yet distinct.</p>
<p>Ideally, Tableau should commission its own font. There is no agreement about which is the best font to display numbers. Settle the question by creating that font! Anyone who would use this font in Desktop, Public or otherwise will subtly scream &#8220;Ra Ra Tableau&#8221;.</p>
<p>Then, offer several themes to choose from. In my view, Tableau encourages user to focus on what question to ask the data. Once this is done the resulting &#8220;visual query&#8221; should look ok, or require very little rework to be publishable as is. Today moving away from the arial bold, arial, light gray background on header scheme does require a lot of rework, and shouldn&#8217;t. Other Washington-based software firms have been offering themes for ages. Now look at all the existing Office palettes. They all are quite good. I have trouble using the default colors because it really says: this guy hasn&#8217;t given half a thought to color. At least I am aware that many very acceptable choices exist. I think it&#8217;s a reasonable stance.</p>
<h2>Node-link graphs</h2>
<p>Node-link graphs, or as they really should be called, graphs, are the most useful way to represent relationship across data elements. If your dataset has items and relationship between them (like movements from a place to another, transactions from an entity to another, people and how they relate to another&#8230; there are really many examples), a graph can show quickly and elegantly what there is to know about the data.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1084" style="width: 606px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://bl.ocks.org/1153292"><img class="size-full wp-image-1084" title="Moblie-patent-suits" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Moblie-patent-suits.png" alt="" width="596" height="390" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mobile patent suits, by Mike Bostock</p></div></p>
<p>I insist on the &#8220;quick insight&#8221; part because I believe that fundamentally this is what Tableau is about. Many people, including me, use Tableau systematically on a new dataset they try to understand. It&#8217;s very quick and efficient to explore data with Tableau and find out what&#8217;s interesting in a dataset. You&#8217;ll find consensus in the visual community that Tableau is the best &#8220;drafting tool&#8221; ever.</p>
<p>Back on graphs. One problem with graphs is that since they are not in the Excel canonical list of charts, they are not in the mindset of most corporate users.</p>
<p>Graphs, I believe, would be relatively easy to include in the Tableau toolkit. There are several algorithms that can calculate where the nodes should be drawn. This is not unlike drawing a map &#8211; suddenly the x and y come from lat-lon coordinates which are deduced from the underlying data. Likewise an algorithm could assign x and y coordinates to any row.  Then all there remains to do is draw a dot or shape with all the standard attributes, color, size, etc. Links between nodes could be handled by the line object.</p>
<p>When I told Jock about graphs he asked me what would I do with that. Oh, I had some ready ideas: as an HR manager, I could visualize all the relationship in my company. There are many explicit (work in the same team) but also implicit (have worked together in the past, graduated in the same school, similar interests, offices close by etc) relationship in HR files. Or, logistics &#8211; I could represent my itineraries non-geographically. Suddenly I can make cartograms (which are usually tricky to do) instead of maps.</p>
<p>In retrospect this is not the right way to approach the problem. I&#8217;ve only worked in a handful of positions and industries. There are thousands of different jobs in as many domains who can look at data with different lenses. What I do know as a data visualization person is that graphs are useful and that if people who traditionally didn&#8217;t have access to them could pull them instantly on their data &#8211; fantastic things may occur.</p>
<h2>Treemaps and hierarchical charts</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style:"width:354px">
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://public.tableausoftware.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js"></script>
<div class="tableauPlaceholder" style="width:354px; height:419px;"><noscript><a href="#"><img alt="circle " src="http:&#47;&#47;public.tableausoftware.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;pa&#47;packing&#47;circle&#47;1_rss.png" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; border: none" /></a></noscript><object class="tableauViz" width="354" height="419" style="display:none;"><param name="host_url" value="http%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableausoftware.com%2F" /><param name="name" value="packing&#47;circle" /><param name="tabs" value="no" /><param name="toolbar" value="no" /><param name="static_image" value="http:&#47;&#47;public.tableausoftware.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;pa&#47;packing&#47;circle&#47;1.png" /><param name="animate_transition" value="yes" /><param name="display_static_image" value="yes" /><param name="display_spinner" value="yes" /><param name="display_overlay" value="yes" /></object></div>
<div style="width:354px;height:22px;padding:0px 10px 0px 0px;color:black;font:normal 8pt verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
<div style="float:right; padding-right:8px;"><a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/public?ref=http://public.tableausoftware.com/views/packing/circle" target="_blank">Powered by Tableau</a></div>
</div>
<p class="wp-caption-text">A circle map done with Tableau. This was slightly cumbersome and doesn&#8217;t work so well. This is also the biggest you can do as it uses the size property of circles, here at its maximum. Coordinates of circles are computed outside of Tableau. My attempts at making a treemap are, well, less polished. The dataset is the flare class hierarchy as in <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/pack.html">here</a></p>
</div>
<p>I could say pretty much the same thing about treemaps: they are very useful, especially since tabulated datasets, the bread and butter of Tableau, often contain hiearachies. Yet they are not part of the Excel family so if you&#8217;ve never worked with them you can&#8217;t feel you need them.</p>
<p>So I asked Jock, why doesn&#8217;t Tableau have treemaps? It makes sense, IMO. Treemaps are one of the few &#8220;advanced&#8221; visualization tools which have gained quasi-acceptance. I really see that as a progress. Isn&#8217;t there a natural match with Tableau? Jock answer was that the problem with treemap is that they do not fit well with Tableau algebra. To turn a dataset into a treemap would require a specific process that can&#8217;t generalize well like the rest of Tableau.</p>
<h3>See? There&#8217;s your problem</h3>
<p>So instead (or rather as a first step) I suggest Tableau adds an attribute to marks: a secondary size attribute. See it this way: if only one size attribute is filled, then it governs all aspects of the size of a mark (height, width, area, diagonal you name it. It would be proportional to all). But if there are two sizes one will affect height, the other, width. So yes, we can do rectangles. And ellipses too. Now that in itself is not half-bad. Fattened stars or what not, I don&#8217;t know what to do with them but rectangles and ellipses, now&#8230;</p>
<p>Now once you can handle rectangles, once you can handle layouts (which you can, because: maps), you can have treemaps, and/or any hierarchy or packing algorithm. I think we can stop at treemaps but folks at Tableau know there are wide, (mostly) unexplored territories beyond this point.</p>
<h2>Tableau and storytelling</h2>
<h3>Stateful urls</h3>
<p>OK this is the innovation that was already in the pipeline when I mentioned it. It would be very useful to have a system of stateful urls for Tableau public. What is that? The possibility to pass a set of parameters in addition to the url of a view, so that it is in a certain state. So the same dashboard could be shared in different states (for instance, with different items selected, or different filters) without having to be saved several times under several different names.</p>
<p>Bonus: dashboards under a certain state, if they can be uniquely identified through those parameters, can then be shared on facebook and twitter as is.</p>
<p>All of this is taken care of.</p>
<h3>Interactive slides framework</h3>
<p>Now the next step: an interactive slides framework.</p>
<p>The interactive slideshow, once<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/11/03/us/politics/election-results-house-shift.html?ref=politics"> quasi-exclusive to the New York Times</a>, is now <a href="http://riskreport.weforum.org/#/0/1">gaining in popularity</a>.</p>
<p>The idea? there is a structure like the common slideshow, where the user can go to the next or previous slide, guided by a narrative. But at any step instead of following the flow, they can stop and interact with the view they have.</p>
<p>That said despite being a simple idea it requires quite an amount of overwork to implement properly. It makes sense for Tableau to have their own framework so users can arrange nicely a sequence of views in the desktop tool, for instance dashboards in specific states, with an extra layer of commentary if needs be, and then deploy the finished product which can be embedded in one location as opposed to requiring the user to embed several vizzes in one page. The advantage would be that the reader would go from one to the other as intended by the author, with a supporting narrative or explanations, and wouldn&#8217;t be required to explore or interact with each one to get an idea of what is going on.</p>

	<section class="post-content">

		<p>If you think of data visualization as a great way to bring together heaps of interesting data and, well, a visual language, one of the most exciting areas in terms of room for improvement has to be how surveys are visualized.<br />
In conversations with my pollster friend <a href="http://www.twitter.com/#!/laguirlande">@laguirlande</a>, I often find myself regretting that when reading an opinion survey, we see answer tallies in isolation. That is: we can see what proportion of people gave the first answer to question A, and what proportion of people gave the second answer to question B. But what we we <em>don&#8217;t</em> know is, out of the first group, how many find themselves in the second?<br />
Another frustration: survey data is very tabulated. Pollsters know respondents age, gender, and all kind of categories they can fit their respondents in. But again when reading the results, more often than not it is not possible to utilize this structure to filter answers by category &#8211; do men react like women to the issue?<br />
Yet opinion surveys are always interesting and topical, else they wouldn&#8217;t be paid for. And the interestingness may lie there: little nuggets of data that could have escaped analysts could be found by readers as they try various manipulations.</p>
<p>And then last week, Chanel 4 released the <a href="http://sexperienceuk.channel4.com/the-sexperience-1000">sexperience 1000</a>, a project around the &#8220;Great British Sex Survey&#8221; by Ipsos MORI, which as its name implies is a large-scale survey on sexual practices of UK citizens.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The project walks us through around 20 questions where little icons represent individual respondents. When the reader changes questions, the icons arrange themselves in bars or circles to form a chart.<br />
<a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1046" title="sexperience1" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience1.png" alt="" width="720" height="454" /></a></p>
<h3>Yes, filtering! Yes, cross-tabulating!</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is then possible to click on a column label to &#8220;track&#8221; that group and find out what they&#8217;ve been up to.<br />
Here, for instance, we can select the group of people who had over 101 partners and follow them through another question: the longest period without intercourse, for instance.<br />
<a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1046" title="sexperience2" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience2.png" alt="" width="720" height="454" /></a><br />
The selected individuals will show in green, so we can see that some of them went through long periods of abstinence.<br />
<a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience3.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1046" title="sexperience2" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience3.png" alt="" width="720" height="454" /></a></p>
<p>It is also possible to select one interesting individual and see all of their answers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is also possible to filter the individuals according to many categories. Here, for instance, we can see that a majority of respondents had intercourse in a car. Including quite a few who don&#8217;t drive or don&#8217;t have a car!<br />
<a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience4.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1046" title="sexperience2" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience4.png" alt="" width="720" height="454" /></a><br />
<a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience5.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1046" title="sexperience2" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience5.png" alt="" width="720" height="454" /></a></p>
<h3>Great interactivity, yet legibility could be improved</h3>
<p>Those functions are truly great and encourage the reader to explore. Yet the choice of representation makes it a bit difficult to understand the answers.</p>
<p><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience1.png"><img title="sexperience1" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience1.png" alt="" width="720" height="454" /></a><br />
Going back to the first chart I showed about the number of partners for instance, this representation highlights the <em>mode</em>, the most frequent answer to the question. In this case, this is the 11-20 bracket with 121 answers. A close second is just 1 partner (120 answers). The composition of the answer brackets has a lot of influence on that, because if we had made a 5-9 bracket for instance it would have outweighed both (217). Also, they chose not to directly represent the people who had 0 partners, which are over 7% of the respondents.<br />
More fundamentally, I suppose that people want to know where do they fit in the distribution. Are they normal? Less then the norm? Or better? From that chart it&#8217;s very difficult.<br />
With that in mind, it&#8217;s more relevant to show a cumulative chart.</p>
<p><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexsurvey1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1053" title="sexsurvey" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexsurvey1.png" alt="" /></a><br />
Less than 5! who would have known?</p>
<p>The site choose to display bar charts when the answer is quantitative, but to present circles for qualitative questions. This is fine when several circles are displayed: it&#8217;s ok to figure out if one is bigger than the other.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience71.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1052" title="sexperience7" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience71.png" alt="" width="720" height="454" /></a></p>
<p>But it&#8217;s much harder when only one is shown, like for the question on places I&#8217;ve shown above. It&#8217;s difficult to know whether this is a &#8220;big circle&#8221; or &#8220;small circle&#8221; without any indication of the total size of the sample. I only know that the majority of respondents had intercourse in a car because of the small number 550 next to the circle, but there is no graphical way to show that.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It&#8217;s even harder to compare proportions across groups which have different sizes.<br />
<a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience6.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1046" title="sexperience2" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience6.png" alt="" width="720" height="454" /></a></p>
<p>Here, for instance, I&#8217;m trying to see whether people with an iPhone are more likely to cheat on their partners. What I see is two grey bubbles &#8211; it&#8217;s relatively easy to say that one is bigger than the other &#8211; then two smaller blue and pink ones, which are harder to compare one to another because they are smaller. What&#8217;s even harder is to assess whether the ratio between the larger balls is greater or smaller than the one between the smaller balls. However, the proportion between both balls (that is the share of the respondents who have an iPhone) is relatively easy to figure out, too bad it doesn&#8217;t answer the question at all.<br />
To compare across groups of different size, you just can&#8217;t escape switching to proportions. I understand the design choice and enjoy its consistency but in this case it goes against the function of the site. I feel that in this case, the designers chose playability and aesthetic appeal over ease of getting questions answered, which is not a bad choice per se condidering the subject and audience, even if there are more academic possibilities. At any rate, the Sexperience 1000 shows the way survey results could be displayed and is a great improvement over the current situation.</p>

Last month, <a href="http://www.visualizing.org/">visualizing.org</a> organized an event in Brussels to gather European dataviz folks. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, the main output of that is that a handful of those present decided to create an informal discussion group to share ideas and promote data visualization. The group as it currently stands includes <a href="http://www.twitter.com/#!/datavis">@datavis</a> (@wiederkehr), <a href="http://www.twitter.com/#!/FILWD">@FILWD</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/#!/infosthetics">@infosthetics</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/#!/janwillemtulp">@janwillemtulp</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/#!/moritz_stefaner">@moritz_stefaner</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/#!/visualisingdata">@visualisingdata</a> and myself (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/#!/jcukier">@jcukier</a>).</p>
<p>Before going any further <strong>I invite you to follow any and all of these accounts</strong> you don&#8217;t yet follow on twitter. You would be in great company (see below).
</p>
<p>This week I was looking at the Twitter API and had the idea to compare our respective friends and followers on twitter. We have very different profiles.<br />
First, we are all based in a different country, except for @filwd and @moritz_stefaner who are both in Germany. Also the interest of our audiences are different. </p>
<p>Still, I was suprised to see that there was not that much overlap among our followers. For each of us, at least one third of our followers do not follow any of the other accounts. So, even for @infosthetics which has over 8000 followers, the collective audience of the group is approximately twice as much. </p>
<p><script src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/smallTreemap.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</p>
<p>So anyway, I conducted some further analysis to answer some questions such as: </p>
<ul>
<li>which accounts follow several of us, but not one specific account?</li>
<li>among the followers unique to an account, which have many followers? (ie @datavis is being followed, and occasionally RT&#8217;d, by @alyssa_milano!)
<li>which accounts are being followed by many of us?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/stuff/unum3.html">you can find the detail here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>So the 22 accounts that currently follow our 8 accounts are:<br />

		<p>This year I have participated to the <a href="http://hcil.cs.umd.edu/localphp/hcil/vast11/index.php/">VAST Challenge</a> (VAST stands for visual analytics science and technology). The VAST symposium is part of the yearly VisWeek conferences. </p>
<p>Anyway. The rules required contestants to send videos with voiceovers, so without further ado here they are. </p>

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMPZJLms9tU&#038;hd=1">Watch me in HD too!!</a></p>
<p>If you want to play with the tools you can download them here: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5259106/mc1.zip">mini-challenge 1</a>, <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5259106/mc3.zip">mini-challenge 3</a>. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I couldn&#8217;t find the time to complete mini-challenge 2 and the grand challenge. I&#8217;m making this on my free time and I had to balance all kinds of commitments, so I couldn&#8217;t secure enough time to finish. Unlike previous years, though, I managed to find enough time to start ! so, in the words of Charlie Sheen: winning.</p>
<p>So what is this about?<br />
In the fictional Vastopolis, a mysterious infection strikes. Where does it come from and how is this transmitted? To answer these questions we have one million tweets sent by residents in the past 3 weeks. and among that million, there are quite a few about people reporting symptoms. </p>
<p>The first thing that I did was coming up for a method to tell whether one tweet was actually about a disease or not. so I scored them. I made a list of words that were required to consider that one message related to sickness, they were fairly univoquial like sick, flu, pneumonia, etc. Each of those words added one point to a &#8220;sickness&#8221; score. Then there was a second list of more ambiguous words like &#8220;a lot&#8221;, &#8220;pain&#8221;, &#8220;fire&#8221; etc. I added one point for each of these words or phrase, if a message already contains a required word. So, there were a few false negative, a few false positive, but all in all it was fairly accurate. </p>
<p>Fairly soon I had the idea to show the sums of all the scores of a part of the map, rather than showing each individual tweet. But originally, the sectors were quite large and I showed data by day.<br />
 <a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/earlyshot.png"><img src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/earlyshot.png" alt="" title="earlyshot" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-931" /></a></p>
<p>Then, I worked with finer sectors and by 6 hours chunks. That&#8217;s how I could exhibit how people moved towards the center of the map by day, and back to its edges every night. With finer geographic details I could also see some spikes in various areas of the map during the period that I couldn&#8217;t see before, which were not necessarily related to the disease.</p>
<p><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/nextshot.png"><img src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/nextshot.png" alt="" title="nextshot" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932" /></a></p>
<p>Eventually, I wanted to read what the tweets corresponded to, so I loaded the full text of the messages so that clicking on a square would reveal what was said at that moment. In this dataset, every spike in volume corresponds with an event that&#8217;s been added by the designers, so it was fun to discover everything happening there, from baseball games to accidents or buildings catching fire. Often, there were articles in the mini-challenge 3 dataset that would give more information about what really happened.</p>
<p>so, what was mini-challenge 3 about? nothing less than diagnosing possible terrorist threat. This time we were given not one million tweets, but thousands of articles which were much longer than 140 characters! From reading a few sample articles, I saw that most didn&#8217;t talk about terrorism or vastopolis at all. But couldn&#8217;t they contain clues that could link 2 and 2? </p>
<p>my first idea was to find all entities in the articles, that is names of people, or names of organizations (which follow a certain syntax) and arrange them in a network. The problem is that there were just too many names and groups (thousands of both) and I couldn&#8217;t tell from such a list which sounded suspicious. Although, a group called &#8220;network of hate&#8221; is probably not a charity. I&#8217;m sure it is possible to solve the challenge like this, but I chose another way to get my first leads.</p>
<p>I just did like in mini-challenge 1 and scored my articles, but I gave them several scores instead of just one by comparing them to several series of words. One series, for instance, was all the proper names in Vastopolis, like names of neighborhoods, because articles <em>about</em> Vastopolis are probably more interesting. The other series corresponded to various kind of threats. </p>
<p>That allowed me to create the scatterplot form which I used both to represent articles and to narrow the selection by selecting an area if needed. Then, as time went by I added more and more features to the tool, for instance an interface to read articles with keywords highlighted, the possibility to filter articles by keyword in addition to a graphical interface, being able to see all the articles as a list and select from that list, not just from the scatterplot, and finally the possiblity to mark articles as interesting and regroup them in another list&#8230;</p>
<p>That was about when I felt I could run out of time, so I didn&#8217;t add the other features I had planned or worked on making a decent interface. Also, I spent a lot of time not just trying to solve the challenge, but reading all the stories that were planted in the dataset, linking them to the tweets of MC1, etc. </p>
<p>Anyway. I quite enjoyed working on that and really, really appreciated the humongous work that went into creating the vast challenge universe. I&#8217;m looking forward seeing what other teams came up with. On a side note, it&#8217;s probably my last protovis projects as it makes sense to completely switch to D3 now&#8230;</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve been posting quite a few times on Tableau these last few days, so I&#8217;ll end up the week with one viz I had previously shared on twitter with some success.<br />

</div>
<p>so what&#8217;s the story?<br />
I have been inspired to do this via the work on <a href="http://www.onformative.com/work/fragments-of-rgb/">onformative</a> which I discovered on <a href="http://butdoesitfloat.com/1420489/One-has-to-arrive-at-a-specific-temperature-at-which-the-objects">But does it float</a>.</p>
<p>I was struck by how the proximity of a red dot, a green dot and a blue dot was interpreted by our human eyes as a spot of another color. Then again, this is how <a href="http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/lcd5.htm">monitors</a> <a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/monitor7.htm">work</a>. If you look hard enough on your lcd screen you may see the sub-pixels.<br />
This is also why, in an image such as this one, the segments of the line appear unaligned, although logically this line is one pixel wide.<br />
<a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/unaligned.png"><img src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/unaligned.png" alt="" title="unaligned" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926" /></a><br />
Physically, the segments are <em>indeed</em> unaligned, as the each segment uses sub-pixels of a different color which don&#8217;t have the same horizontal position within one pixel. </p>
<p>However, I didn&#8217;t realize that this effect would work with patches of blue, green and red much bigger than a subpixel.<br />
I made the underlying dataset from a picture of my daughter Violette when she was 2. I converted the picture to a list of values of red, green and blue (thanks, processing) which were all associated to a x and y position on the screen and the name of their layer (so they could be turned on or off). These x and y positions were derived from the position of the pixel on the original image, but the red, blue and green dots are all shifted in one direction so they form a triangle.<br />
Then, I&#8217;ve added some extra layers as noise to obfuscate the image. </p>
<p>Here, the effect is voluntary. Then again, if you position lots of marks one next to the other, you could re-create it accidentally, and instead of seeing three distinct dots, your users would see just one and of a different color at that!</p>

<div style="float:right; padding-right:8px;"><a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/public?ref=http://public.tableausoftware.com/views/contest2011/WMap" target="_blank">Powered by Tableau</a></div>
</div>
<p>To create my map, I used the default mapping function of Tableau, where you declare the geographic role of two of your measures &#8211; one as latitude, one as longitude &#8211; and you can plot marks on a map, that can be zoomed, panned etc.<br />
<a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/latitude.png"><img src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/latitude.png" alt="" title="latitude" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918" /></a><br />
If one of your dimensions is geographical in nature, like a country, US state, US county name or code, Tableau can calculate latitude and longitude so you don&#8217;t have to provide them. This also works for zip codes. So, if you have a valid US address, you can extract the zip code out of that (before you put your data in Tableau) and Tableau can represent this on a map quite accurately.<br />
In my case, I had tens of thousands of marks, which were available at a much finer level than the zip code (sometimes down to the appartment number) so I thought it would be a pity to aggregate them so. My data came with notions like neighborhood or block numbers, which is specific to the New York administration I suppose, but interesting in my context. That idea of block number sounded like the right level of aggregation for my data.<br />
The problem is, how do I get the latitude and longitude of each of the blocks?<br />
How I did this was to chose one address per block, and then geocode it with python and google maps. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;q=geocoding+python&#038;safe=active">Geocoding </a>is the process of converting addresses, well, in geographical coordinates and while doing it in Python does require coding it is trivial and there are many ready-made examples around which can be reused as is.<br />
then, in my data, I put the coordinates of each block for every record. So any building sale can be associated with a laritude and longitude, which is that of their block.<br />
In another view, I have a simpler map &#8211; by neighborhood. Neighborhoods are another proprietary notion, they are groups of blocks. So, I simply average the latitude and longitude of all the buildings in the neighborhood to position their mark.</p>
<p>While it can be desirable to let users interact with the map, in many cases it is not a safe option. Once you let your users unzoom and/or scrool away from the action, it is not obvious for them to get back.<br />
So Agnieszka has used another nifty technique, that of background images.<br />
Her map is really a static file imported with the background image function which is found in the data menu:<br />
<a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/background-image.png"><img src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/background-image.png" alt="" title="background image" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919" /></a><br />
Like this, the user can really specify what to use for a map, when does it start, where does it end. The map won&#8217;t move afterwards.<br />
However, by doing so one cannot use geographic coordinates to display marks. One has to obtain, outside of Tableau, the x and y coordinates of each mark on the screen. Then, those x and y coordinates can be made into measures, and assigned respectively to the column and row shelves of the viz. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll let you figure out which one is best for your next map project. Note that you can generate highly customizable map backgrounds with a service like <a href="http://www.cloudmade.com/">cloudmade</a>.</p>
