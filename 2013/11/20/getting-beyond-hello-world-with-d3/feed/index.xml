		<description><![CDATA[Hi, hmm this template doesn&#039;t really do anything on its own, so adding a data file won&#039;t make much of a difference. However, most of the visualization code I wrote in the last couple of years follows the same logic. So if you go to one of my published projects like http://www.jeromecukier.net/projects/slopes/slopes.html you can see how the data is first loaded, then rendered.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So I copied your code from the two files above. I put the html code in a file called vis.html and I put the javascript code into a file called template.js. I tried running the code and that didn&#039;t work. Then I realized I needed to use a .txt file with data. I don&#039;t know the setup of the data you used, so I just attempted to use a 7 numbers separated with commas. That didn&#039;t work either.

Could you please provide the data you used for this project, and also could you provide the final names for the files. That would help immensely. 

If you have any other suggestions to why the program may not be working, that would be great.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jerome,

I&#039;m new to D3JS, and I&#039;m trying to get my head around this post.   Do you have a data.csv with dummy data that could be used just to get these template up and running.  I&#039;ve tried creating my own data.csv but it&#039;s not displaying anything.  Do I need to amend the code first, or should it work straight off the bat?

Thanks,
Jonathan]]></description>
