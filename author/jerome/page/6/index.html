	<section class="post-content">

		<p>Normally, at this time of the year, I&#8217;ll be writing a recap of VisWeek. And I will &#8211; the writeups I have been doing for<a href="http://www.visualisingdata.com/"> visualisingdata.com</a> were just highlights of individual talks. But much of my VisWeek 2011 experience happened in between the talks. People you meet, ideas you glimpse, that collide and generate new ideas, plans you make&#8230;</p>
<p>One person I am always happy to meet at VisWeek, and who is visible from afar, is Tableau&#8217;s Jock MacKinlay. Since I couldn&#8217;t attend TCC11, I spent some time talking with Jock and Lori Williams about 7 and plans for the future. Whenever I would start a sentence by &#8220;hmm, you know&#8230;&#8221; Lori or Jock would write it down and ask me to send any remark in writing, so I thought I should do that, but rather than keeping this private, I&#8217;m going to stick to what&#8217;s written on one button I picked up on their stand: do it in public.</p>
<p>For a piece of software that complex, Tableau Desktop/Public has received improvements at an astonishing rate. So fast that one of the recommendations I had is already implemented or ready in the next release. So I have the conviction that Tableau product people care and are on the lookout for useful suggestions on how to move forward. Here are a few.</p>
<h2>On design</h2>
<h3>More fonts please!</h3>
<p>In Tableau Public, you&#8217;re stuck with the windows XP default fonts. That&#8217;s not an awful lot. Is that enough?</p>
<p>For the first 15 years or so of the web, webmasters had to be content with so called web-safe fonts. There was a time where the web was probably 90% verdana and people accepted this like death and taxes. But this is now 2011 and any personal website can be a marvel of customized typography &#8211; at least, the parts around a Tableau viz.</p>
<p>More specifically there are two issues with the current set of fonts.</p>
<p>First, there is no condensed font (think Helvetica Condensed, etc.). But condensed fonts are extremely useful to display numbers in callouts or on axes.</p>
<p>Second, the default font is Arial. This is not a neutral choice. There are lots of adjectives that can be associated with Arial, and frankly I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s right these qualifiers should apply to Tableau. Arial is the default font of Excel pre-2007 , it&#8217;s the font of those bullet-ridden, unstyled, unsavory powerpoint slides that bore us to death for over a decade of unnecessary meetings. Many say it&#8217;s a rip-off of Helvetica.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1082" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/crazy_stupid_love/quotes/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1082" title="crazy-stupid-love-ryan-gosling-steve-carell" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/crazy-stupid-love-ryan-gosling-steve-carell.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="387" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tableau, you&#39;re better than Arial. Say it.</p></div></p>
<p>Being able to chose one&#8217;s font is essential to branding. The typography of my vizzes should concord with that of my website and my brand. Same goes with my colours (more on that in a second). Conversely if any output on my website is not aligned with my brand it denotes a lack of control.</p>
<h3>So what should Tableau do?</h3>
<p>Offer more fonts! There are literally hundreds of proven fonts which would be very well suited for dashboards. Fonts which are not unheard of, yet not trite. Legible, yet distinct.</p>
<p>Ideally, Tableau should commission its own font. There is no agreement about which is the best font to display numbers. Settle the question by creating that font! Anyone who would use this font in Desktop, Public or otherwise will subtly scream &#8220;Ra Ra Tableau&#8221;.</p>
<p>Then, offer several themes to choose from. In my view, Tableau encourages user to focus on what question to ask the data. Once this is done the resulting &#8220;visual query&#8221; should look ok, or require very little rework to be publishable as is. Today moving away from the arial bold, arial, light gray background on header scheme does require a lot of rework, and shouldn&#8217;t. Other Washington-based software firms have been offering themes for ages. Now look at all the existing Office palettes. They all are quite good. I have trouble using the default colors because it really says: this guy hasn&#8217;t given half a thought to color. At least I am aware that many very acceptable choices exist. I think it&#8217;s a reasonable stance.</p>
<h2>Node-link graphs</h2>
<p>Node-link graphs, or as they really should be called, graphs, are the most useful way to represent relationship across data elements. If your dataset has items and relationship between them (like movements from a place to another, transactions from an entity to another, people and how they relate to another&#8230; there are really many examples), a graph can show quickly and elegantly what there is to know about the data.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1084" style="width: 606px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://bl.ocks.org/1153292"><img class="size-full wp-image-1084" title="Moblie-patent-suits" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Moblie-patent-suits.png" alt="" width="596" height="390" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mobile patent suits, by Mike Bostock</p></div></p>
<p>I insist on the &#8220;quick insight&#8221; part because I believe that fundamentally this is what Tableau is about. Many people, including me, use Tableau systematically on a new dataset they try to understand. It&#8217;s very quick and efficient to explore data with Tableau and find out what&#8217;s interesting in a dataset. You&#8217;ll find consensus in the visual community that Tableau is the best &#8220;drafting tool&#8221; ever.</p>
<p>Back on graphs. One problem with graphs is that since they are not in the Excel canonical list of charts, they are not in the mindset of most corporate users.</p>
<p>Graphs, I believe, would be relatively easy to include in the Tableau toolkit. There are several algorithms that can calculate where the nodes should be drawn. This is not unlike drawing a map &#8211; suddenly the x and y come from lat-lon coordinates which are deduced from the underlying data. Likewise an algorithm could assign x and y coordinates to any row.  Then all there remains to do is draw a dot or shape with all the standard attributes, color, size, etc. Links between nodes could be handled by the line object.</p>
<p>When I told Jock about graphs he asked me what would I do with that. Oh, I had some ready ideas: as an HR manager, I could visualize all the relationship in my company. There are many explicit (work in the same team) but also implicit (have worked together in the past, graduated in the same school, similar interests, offices close by etc) relationship in HR files. Or, logistics &#8211; I could represent my itineraries non-geographically. Suddenly I can make cartograms (which are usually tricky to do) instead of maps.</p>
<p>In retrospect this is not the right way to approach the problem. I&#8217;ve only worked in a handful of positions and industries. There are thousands of different jobs in as many domains who can look at data with different lenses. What I do know as a data visualization person is that graphs are useful and that if people who traditionally didn&#8217;t have access to them could pull them instantly on their data &#8211; fantastic things may occur.</p>
<h2>Treemaps and hierarchical charts</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style:"width:354px">
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://public.tableausoftware.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js"></script>
<div class="tableauPlaceholder" style="width:354px; height:419px;"><noscript><a href="#"><img alt="circle " src="http:&#47;&#47;public.tableausoftware.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;pa&#47;packing&#47;circle&#47;1_rss.png" style="height: 100%; width: 100%; border: none" /></a></noscript><object class="tableauViz" width="354" height="419" style="display:none;"><param name="host_url" value="http%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableausoftware.com%2F" /><param name="name" value="packing&#47;circle" /><param name="tabs" value="no" /><param name="toolbar" value="no" /><param name="static_image" value="http:&#47;&#47;public.tableausoftware.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;pa&#47;packing&#47;circle&#47;1.png" /><param name="animate_transition" value="yes" /><param name="display_static_image" value="yes" /><param name="display_spinner" value="yes" /><param name="display_overlay" value="yes" /></object></div>
<div style="width:354px;height:22px;padding:0px 10px 0px 0px;color:black;font:normal 8pt verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
<div style="float:right; padding-right:8px;"><a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/public?ref=http://public.tableausoftware.com/views/packing/circle" target="_blank">Powered by Tableau</a></div>
</div>
<p class="wp-caption-text">A circle map done with Tableau. This was slightly cumbersome and doesn&#8217;t work so well. This is also the biggest you can do as it uses the size property of circles, here at its maximum. Coordinates of circles are computed outside of Tableau. My attempts at making a treemap are, well, less polished. The dataset is the flare class hierarchy as in <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/pack.html">here</a></p>
</div>
<p>I could say pretty much the same thing about treemaps: they are very useful, especially since tabulated datasets, the bread and butter of Tableau, often contain hiearachies. Yet they are not part of the Excel family so if you&#8217;ve never worked with them you can&#8217;t feel you need them.</p>
<p>So I asked Jock, why doesn&#8217;t Tableau have treemaps? It makes sense, IMO. Treemaps are one of the few &#8220;advanced&#8221; visualization tools which have gained quasi-acceptance. I really see that as a progress. Isn&#8217;t there a natural match with Tableau? Jock answer was that the problem with treemap is that they do not fit well with Tableau algebra. To turn a dataset into a treemap would require a specific process that can&#8217;t generalize well like the rest of Tableau.</p>
<h3>See? There&#8217;s your problem</h3>
<p>So instead (or rather as a first step) I suggest Tableau adds an attribute to marks: a secondary size attribute. See it this way: if only one size attribute is filled, then it governs all aspects of the size of a mark (height, width, area, diagonal you name it. It would be proportional to all). But if there are two sizes one will affect height, the other, width. So yes, we can do rectangles. And ellipses too. Now that in itself is not half-bad. Fattened stars or what not, I don&#8217;t know what to do with them but rectangles and ellipses, now&#8230;</p>
<p>Now once you can handle rectangles, once you can handle layouts (which you can, because: maps), you can have treemaps, and/or any hierarchy or packing algorithm. I think we can stop at treemaps but folks at Tableau know there are wide, (mostly) unexplored territories beyond this point.</p>
<h2>Tableau and storytelling</h2>
<h3>Stateful urls</h3>
<p>OK this is the innovation that was already in the pipeline when I mentioned it. It would be very useful to have a system of stateful urls for Tableau public. What is that? The possibility to pass a set of parameters in addition to the url of a view, so that it is in a certain state. So the same dashboard could be shared in different states (for instance, with different items selected, or different filters) without having to be saved several times under several different names.</p>
<p>Bonus: dashboards under a certain state, if they can be uniquely identified through those parameters, can then be shared on facebook and twitter as is.</p>
<p>All of this is taken care of.</p>
<h3>Interactive slides framework</h3>
<p>Now the next step: an interactive slides framework.</p>
<p>The interactive slideshow, once<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/11/03/us/politics/election-results-house-shift.html?ref=politics"> quasi-exclusive to the New York Times</a>, is now <a href="http://riskreport.weforum.org/#/0/1">gaining in popularity</a>.</p>
<p>The idea? there is a structure like the common slideshow, where the user can go to the next or previous slide, guided by a narrative. But at any step instead of following the flow, they can stop and interact with the view they have.</p>
<p>That said despite being a simple idea it requires quite an amount of overwork to implement properly. It makes sense for Tableau to have their own framework so users can arrange nicely a sequence of views in the desktop tool, for instance dashboards in specific states, with an extra layer of commentary if needs be, and then deploy the finished product which can be embedded in one location as opposed to requiring the user to embed several vizzes in one page. The advantage would be that the reader would go from one to the other as intended by the author, with a supporting narrative or explanations, and wouldn&#8217;t be required to explore or interact with each one to get an idea of what is going on.</p>

		<p>Yesterday I attended a workshop organized by <a href="http://www.etalab.gouv.fr/article-4eme-atelier-de-travail-datajournalisme-86096912.html">Etalab on data journalism</a>. Since open data, data visualization and storytelling with data are my 3 work interests I could not just be found elsewhere that day.</p>
<p>Interestingly, while speakers and attendants were very much discussing the same subject, what was said (or inferred in questions asked) was very different. On some topics participants presented opposite opinions,  while on others there was a strong agreement.</p>
<h2>Inspiration and enthusiasm</h2>
<p>That was definitely the common denominator across presentations. </p>
<p>In short: <strong>visualization + journalism = win</strong>. </p>
<p>Every presenter, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/!#/dataveyes">@dataveyes</a>, Pierre Falga, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/!#/datastore">@datastore</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/!#/sayseal">@sayseal</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/!#/we_do_data">@we_do_data</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/!#/epelboin">@epelboin</a> all showed are talked about things which were pretty awesome and which would have not been possible with data or visualization. While I was familiar with the other examples, I was most fired up by Fabrice Epelboin&#8217;s presentation of Tunisian media, Fhimt.com and its <a href="http://dataviz.fhimt.com/">dataviz gallery</a>.</p>
<p>What was interesting was how it was easy to tell a memorable story with the support of data. I think for the picture to be complete you also have to include in the big picture the viewer&#8217;s assumption and the presenter/journalist narration. One example which was shown by both Caroline Goulard and Simon Rogers is the relationship between tweets and UK riots.</p>
<p>The unsaid assumption was that social media have helped organize the riots.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/interactive/2011/aug/24/riots-twitter-traffic-interactive"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1061" title="guardian" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/guardian.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Facts in hand, in turns out that the bulks of the tweets related to a  riot happened after, not before, the event.  So the narrator help us conclude that riot caused tweets rather than the other way around.</p>
<p>Another example from <a href="http://www.fhimt.com/">fhimt.com</a>:<br />
We assume that tertiary graduates have better job prospects than those with less education.<br />
<a href="http://dataviz.fhimt.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/chomage.001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-380" title="chomage.001" src="http://dataviz.fhimt.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/chomage.001.jpg" alt="" width="819" height="614"></a><br />
This isn&#8217;t the case in Tunisia where there graduates endure a 23% unemployment rate, while the rate for those who haven&#8217;t completed primary school is around 5%.<br />
Comment by Fabrice Epelboin: the only thing left to do for them is prepare the revolution. I find this a very clear and rational explanation of the arab spring, in contrast with how television presented those events.</p>
<h2>Is this difficult?</h2>
<h3>It requires work</h3>
<p>And no one denies this. Cécile Dehesdin and We Do Data presented us their work process, from the original idea to the final piece. Cécile would stress more the usage aspects while Karen and François emphasized the benefits of illustration and aesthetics to the final result. They both tried to convey us the amount of time and effort it takes to achieve something. </p>
<h3>and ressources&#8230; or not</h3>
<p>Then Pierre Falga and Simon Rogers gave somewhat conflicting views of the inner working of a newsroom. While Simon Rogers depicts the process as relatively effortless and quick thanks to freely available tools, Pierre Falga&#8217;s views where that an online newsroom&#8217;s resources were very thin, which prevented most media from fully embracing data journalism. To nuance Rogers position and bring it closer to consensus, he argues that <strong>the work-intensive part is</strong> not the output proper, but rather <strong>the data collection</strong>, and like Cécile and Pierre he had his share of horror stories on this front. </p>
<h2>Thank you, open data</h2>
<p>All presenters were grateful for data being increasingly accessible through open data initiatives. Not all is rosy in dataland, however, as institutions here and there are not all excited about doing the prospects of spending their own resources to retrieve data for journalists &#8211; even in the case where they are legally forced to.<br />
While <strong>data journalism obviously need open data, the reverse is possibly truer</strong> &#8211; that may be the motive for Etalab to organize the event. So far, official data portals haven&#8217;t proved to be directly useful to the concerned citizen, so it is those who are able to utilize those free data and turn them into attention-arresting stories that give them a purpose and demonstrate very visibly that the open data process truly benefits all. </p>
<h2>Is there a demand for data journalism?</h2>
<p>Presenters didn&#8217;t all address this question frontally but seemed to have mixed opinions about that. The guardian has been resorting to data journalism for over one century and gave no impression to ever have reconsidered the question. Others in the rooms, including attendants, had less faith on the matter. Pierre Falga and Eric Mettoux from lexpress.fr admitted their share of responsibility as that demand is largely dependent on the supply of quality material from existing media. </p>
<p>More fundamentally, I see that the mix of data visualization and communication is commonly referred to as data journalism which may be a slight over simplification.<br />
<strong>Why would the task of communicating with data visualization be restricted to journalists or media?</strong> <strong>Companies and government</strong> agencies alike have considerable budgets devoted to communication. IMO they <strong>should be the ones driving that effort</strong>. To a curious audience, that is, to the people who are actively seeking information on a certain topic, data visualization answers can be insanely more powerful and cost-effective than classic communication tailored for a more passive receiver. </p>

	<section class="post-content">

		<p>If you think of data visualization as a great way to bring together heaps of interesting data and, well, a visual language, one of the most exciting areas in terms of room for improvement has to be how surveys are visualized.<br />
In conversations with my pollster friend <a href="http://www.twitter.com/#!/laguirlande">@laguirlande</a>, I often find myself regretting that when reading an opinion survey, we see answer tallies in isolation. That is: we can see what proportion of people gave the first answer to question A, and what proportion of people gave the second answer to question B. But what we we <em>don&#8217;t</em> know is, out of the first group, how many find themselves in the second?<br />
Another frustration: survey data is very tabulated. Pollsters know respondents age, gender, and all kind of categories they can fit their respondents in. But again when reading the results, more often than not it is not possible to utilize this structure to filter answers by category &#8211; do men react like women to the issue?<br />
Yet opinion surveys are always interesting and topical, else they wouldn&#8217;t be paid for. And the interestingness may lie there: little nuggets of data that could have escaped analysts could be found by readers as they try various manipulations.</p>
<p>And then last week, Chanel 4 released the <a href="http://sexperienceuk.channel4.com/the-sexperience-1000">sexperience 1000</a>, a project around the &#8220;Great British Sex Survey&#8221; by Ipsos MORI, which as its name implies is a large-scale survey on sexual practices of UK citizens.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The project walks us through around 20 questions where little icons represent individual respondents. When the reader changes questions, the icons arrange themselves in bars or circles to form a chart.<br />
<a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1046" title="sexperience1" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience1.png" alt="" width="720" height="454" /></a></p>
<h3>Yes, filtering! Yes, cross-tabulating!</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is then possible to click on a column label to &#8220;track&#8221; that group and find out what they&#8217;ve been up to.<br />
Here, for instance, we can select the group of people who had over 101 partners and follow them through another question: the longest period without intercourse, for instance.<br />
<a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1046" title="sexperience2" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience2.png" alt="" width="720" height="454" /></a><br />
The selected individuals will show in green, so we can see that some of them went through long periods of abstinence.<br />
<a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience3.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1046" title="sexperience2" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience3.png" alt="" width="720" height="454" /></a></p>
<p>It is also possible to select one interesting individual and see all of their answers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is also possible to filter the individuals according to many categories. Here, for instance, we can see that a majority of respondents had intercourse in a car. Including quite a few who don&#8217;t drive or don&#8217;t have a car!<br />
<a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience4.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1046" title="sexperience2" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience4.png" alt="" width="720" height="454" /></a><br />
<a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience5.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1046" title="sexperience2" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience5.png" alt="" width="720" height="454" /></a></p>
<h3>Great interactivity, yet legibility could be improved</h3>
<p>Those functions are truly great and encourage the reader to explore. Yet the choice of representation makes it a bit difficult to understand the answers.</p>
<p><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience1.png"><img title="sexperience1" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience1.png" alt="" width="720" height="454" /></a><br />
Going back to the first chart I showed about the number of partners for instance, this representation highlights the <em>mode</em>, the most frequent answer to the question. In this case, this is the 11-20 bracket with 121 answers. A close second is just 1 partner (120 answers). The composition of the answer brackets has a lot of influence on that, because if we had made a 5-9 bracket for instance it would have outweighed both (217). Also, they chose not to directly represent the people who had 0 partners, which are over 7% of the respondents.<br />
More fundamentally, I suppose that people want to know where do they fit in the distribution. Are they normal? Less then the norm? Or better? From that chart it&#8217;s very difficult.<br />
With that in mind, it&#8217;s more relevant to show a cumulative chart.</p>
<p><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexsurvey1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1053" title="sexsurvey" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexsurvey1.png" alt="" /></a><br />
Less than 5! who would have known?</p>
<p>The site choose to display bar charts when the answer is quantitative, but to present circles for qualitative questions. This is fine when several circles are displayed: it&#8217;s ok to figure out if one is bigger than the other.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience71.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1052" title="sexperience7" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience71.png" alt="" width="720" height="454" /></a></p>
<p>But it&#8217;s much harder when only one is shown, like for the question on places I&#8217;ve shown above. It&#8217;s difficult to know whether this is a &#8220;big circle&#8221; or &#8220;small circle&#8221; without any indication of the total size of the sample. I only know that the majority of respondents had intercourse in a car because of the small number 550 next to the circle, but there is no graphical way to show that.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It&#8217;s even harder to compare proportions across groups which have different sizes.<br />
<a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience6.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1046" title="sexperience2" src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sexperience6.png" alt="" width="720" height="454" /></a></p>
<p>Here, for instance, I&#8217;m trying to see whether people with an iPhone are more likely to cheat on their partners. What I see is two grey bubbles &#8211; it&#8217;s relatively easy to say that one is bigger than the other &#8211; then two smaller blue and pink ones, which are harder to compare one to another because they are smaller. What&#8217;s even harder is to assess whether the ratio between the larger balls is greater or smaller than the one between the smaller balls. However, the proportion between both balls (that is the share of the respondents who have an iPhone) is relatively easy to figure out, too bad it doesn&#8217;t answer the question at all.<br />
To compare across groups of different size, you just can&#8217;t escape switching to proportions. I understand the design choice and enjoy its consistency but in this case it goes against the function of the site. I feel that in this case, the designers chose playability and aesthetic appeal over ease of getting questions answered, which is not a bad choice per se condidering the subject and audience, even if there are more academic possibilities. At any rate, the Sexperience 1000 shows the way survey results could be displayed and is a great improvement over the current situation.</p>

	<section class="post-content">

		<p>In <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/protovis/docs/scale.html">protovis</a>, scales were super-useful in just about everything. That much hasn&#8217;t changed in d3, even though <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Scales">d3.scale</a> is a bit different from pv.Scale. (do note that <strong>d3.scale</strong> is in lowercase for starters).</p>
<h2>Scales: the main idea</h2>
<p>Simply put: scales transform a number in a certain interval (called the <em>domain</em>) into a number in another interval (called the <em>range</em>).<br />
<img src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/d3scale1.png" alt="an example of how scales work" /><br />
For instance, let&#8217;s suppose you <em>know</em> your data is always over 20 and always below 80. You would like to plot it, say, in a bar chart, which can be only 120 pixels tall.<br />
You could, obviously, do the math:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">.attr(&quot;height&quot;, function(d) {return (d-20)*2;})</pre>
<p>But what if you suddenly have more or less space? or your data changes? you&#8217;d have to go back to the entrails of your code and make the change. This is very error prone. So instead, you can use a scale: </p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">var y=d3.scale.linear().domain(20,80).range(0,120);
...
.attr(&quot;height&quot;, y)</pre>
<p>this is much simpler, elegant, and easy to maintain. Oh, and the latter notation is equivalent to
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">.attr(&quot;height&quot;, function(d) {return y(d);})</pre>
<p>&#8230; only more legible and shorter.<br />
And, there are tons of possibility with scales. </p>
<h2>Fun with scales</h2>
<p>In d3, quantitative scales can be of several types: </p>
<ul>
<li>linear scales (including <em>quantize</em> and <em>quantile</em> scales,</li>
<li>logarithmic scales,</li>
<li>power scales (including <em>square root</em> scales)</li>
</ul>
<p>While they behave differently, they have a lot in common. </p>
<h3>Domain and range</h3>
<p>For all scales, with the exception of quantize and quantile scales which are a bit different, domain and range work the same.<br />
First, note that <strong>unlike in protovis</strong>, domain and range take an array as argument. Compare:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">var y=pv.Scale.linear().range(20,60).domain(0,120);
var y=d3.scale.linear().range([20,60]).domain([0,120]);</pre>
<p>This is because <strong>contrary to protovis</strong>, where domain could be a whole dataset, in d3, domain contains the bounds of the interval that is going to be transformed.<br />
Typically, this is two numbers. If this is more, we are talking about a polypoint scale: there are as many segments in the intervals as there are numbers in the domain (minus one). The range must have as many numbers, and so as many segments. When using the scale, if a number is in the n-th segment of the domain, it is transformed into a number in the n-th segment of the range.<br />
<img src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/d3scaleMultipoint.png" alt="illustration of a multipoint scale" /><br />
With this example, 30 finds itself in the first segment of the domain. So it&#8217;s transformed to a value in the first segment of the range. 60, however, is in the 2nd segment, so it&#8217;s transformed into a value in the 2nd segment of the range.<br />
Also, bounds of domain and range need not be numbers, as long as they can be converted to numbers. One useful examples are colors. Color names can be used as range, for instance, to create <em>color ramps</em>:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">var ramp=d3.scale.linear().domain([0,100]).range([&quot;red&quot;,&quot;blue&quot;]);</pre>
<p>This will transform any value betwen 0 and 100 into the corresponding color between red and blue.</p>
<h3>Clamping</h3>
<p>What happends if the scale is asked to process a number outside of the domain? That&#8217;s what clamping controls. If it is set, then the bounds of the range are the minimum and maximum value that can be returned by the scale. Else, the same transformation applies to all numbers, whether they fall within the domain or not.<br />
<img src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/d3clamping.png" alt="Clamping example" /><br />
Here, with clamping, the result of the linear transformation is 120, but without it, it&#8217;s 160. </p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">var clamp=d3.scale.linear().domain([20,80]).range([0,120]);
clamp(100); // 160
clamp.clamp(true);
clamp(100); // 120</pre>
<h3>Scales and nice numbers</h3>
<p>More often than not, the bounds of the domain and/or those of the ranges will be calculated. So, chances are they won&#8217;t be round numbers, or numbers a human would like. Scales, however, come with a bunch of method to address that. d3 keeps in mind that scales are often used to position marks along an axis.</p>
<h4>.nice()</h4>
<p>When applied to a scale, the nice method expends the domain to &#8220;nicer&#8221; numbers. You wouldn&#8217;t want your axis to start at -2.347 and end at 7.431, right?<br />
So, there. </p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">var data=[-2.347, 4, 5.23,-1.234,6.234,7.431]; // or whatever.
var y=d3.scale.linear().range([0,120]);
y.domain([d3.min(data), d3.max(data)]); // domain takes bounds as arguments, not all numbers
y.domain() // [-2.347, 7.431];
y.nice() // [-3, 8]</pre>
<h4>.ticks(n)</h4>
<p>Given a domain, and a number n (which, <strong>contrary to protovis, is mandatory in d3</strong>), the ticks method will split your domain in (more or less) n convenient, human-readable values, and return an array of these values. This is especially useful to label axes. Passing these values to the scale allows them to position ticks nicely on an axis. </p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">var y=d3.scale.linear([20,80]).range([0,120]);
...
var ticks=axis.selectAll(&quot;line&quot;)
  .data(y.ticks(4)) // 20, 40, 60 and 80
  .enter().append(&quot;svg:line&quot;);
ticks
  .attr(&quot;x1&quot;,0).attr(&quot;x2&quot;,5)
  .attr(&quot;y1&quot;,y).attr(&quot;y2&quot;,y) // short and simple. 
  .attr(&quot;stroke&quot;,&quot;black&quot;);</pre>
<h4>.rangeRound()</h4>
<p>If used instead of .range(), this will guarantee that the output of the scales are integers, which is better to position marks on the screen with pixel precision than numbers with decimals. </p>
<h4>.invert()</h4>
<p>The invert function turns the scale upside down: for one given number in the range, it returns which number of the domain would have been transformed into that number.<br />
For instance: </p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">var y=d3.scale.linear([20,80]).range([0,120]);
y(50); // 60
y.invert(60); // 50</pre>
<p>That&#8217;s quite useful, for instance, when a user mouses over a chart, and you would like to know to what value the mouse coordinates correspond. </p>
<h3>Power scales and log scales</h3>
<p>The <em>linear</em>scale is a function of the form y=ax+b which works for both ends of the domain and range. In the example we&#8217;ve used most often until now, this function is really f(x): y=2x-40.<br />
Power and logarithm scales work the same, only we are looking for a function of the form y=ax<sup>k</sup>+b, or y=a.log(x)+b.<br />
For the power scales, you can specify an exponent (k) with the .exponent() method. For instance, if we specify an exponent of 2, here is what the scale would look like:<br />
<img src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/d3scalePower.png" alt="an example of a power scale" /><br />
The equation is now f(x): y=x²/50-8. So 20 still becomes 0 and 80 still becomes 120, but other than that the values at the beginning of the domain would be lower than with the linear scale, and those at the end of the scale will be higher.<br />
For convenience, d3 includes a d3.scale.sqrt() (the square root scale) so you never have to type d3.scale.pow.exponent(0.5) in full.<br />
Also note that if you are using a log scale, you <strong>cannot</strong> have 0 in the domain. </p>
<h3>Quantize and quantile</h3>
<p>quantize and quantile are specific linear scales.<br />
quantize works with a discrete, rather than continuous, range: in other terms, the output of quantize can only take a certain number of values.<br />
For instance: </p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">var q=d3.scale.quantize().domain([0,10]).range([0,2,8]); 
q(0); // 0
q(3); // 0
q(3.33); // 0
q(3.34); // 2
q(5); // 2
q(6.66); // 2
q(6.67); // 8
q(8); // 8
q(1000); // 8</pre>
<p>quantile on the other hand matches values in the domain (which, this time, is the full dataset) with their respective quantile. The number of quantiles is specified by the range.<br />
For instance: </p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">
var q=d3.scale.quantile().domain([0,1,5,6,2,4,6,2,4,6,7,8]).range([0,100]);
q.quantiles(); // [4.5], only one quantile - the median
q(0); // 0
q(4); // 0
q(4.499); // 0
q(4.5); // 100 - over the median
q(5); // 100
q(10000); // 100
q.range([0,25,50,75,100]);
q.quantiles(); // [2, 4, 5.6, 6];
q(0); // 0 
q(2); // 25 - greater than the first quantile limit
q(3); // 25
q(4); // 50
q(6); // 100
q(10000); // 100</pre>
<h3>Ordinal scales</h3>
<p>All the scales we&#8217;ve seen so far have been quantitative, but how about ordinal scales?<br />
The big difference is that ordinal scales have <strong>a discrete domain</strong>, in other words, they turn a limited number of values into something else, without caring for what&#8217;s between those values.<br />
Ordinal scales are very useful for positioning marks along an x axis. Let&#8217;s suppose you have 10 bars to position for your bar chart, each corresponding to a category, a month or whatever.<br />
For instance: </p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">
var x=d3.scale.ordinal()
  .domain([&quot;Sunday&quot;,&quot;Monday&quot;,&quot;Tuesday&quot;,&quot;Wednesday&quot;,&quot;Thursday&quot;,&quot;Friday&quot;,&quot;Saturday&quot;]) // 7 items
  .rangeBands([0,120]);
x(&quot;Tuesday&quot;); // 34.285714285714285
</pre>
<p>There are 3 possibilites for range. Two are similar: the .rangePoints() and .rangeBands() methods, which both work with an array of two numbers &#8211; i.e. .rangeBands([0,120]). The last one is to specify all values in the range with .range(). </p>
<h4>rangePoints() and rangeBands()</h4>
<p>With .rangePoints(<em>interval</em>), d3 fits n points within the interval, n being the number of categories in the domain. In that case, the value of the first point is the beginning of the interval, that of the last point is the end of the interval.<br />
With .rangeBands(<em>interval</em>), d3 fit n <em>bands</em> within the interval. Here, the value of the last item in the domain is less than the upper bound of the interval.<br />
Those methods <strong>replace the protovis methods</strong> .split() and .splitBanded().<br />
<img src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/d3ordinalRange.png" alt="difference between rangeBands and rangePoints" /><br />
This chart illustrates the difference between using rangeBands and rangePoints. </p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">var x=d3.scale.ordinal()
  .domain([&quot;Sunday&quot;,&quot;Monday&quot;,&quot;Tuesday&quot;,&quot;Wednesday&quot;,&quot;Thursday&quot;,&quot;Friday&quot;,&quot;Saturday&quot;]);
x.rangePoints([0,120]);
x(&quot;Saturday&quot;); // 120
x.rangeBands([0,120]);
x(&quot;Saturday&quot;); // 102.85714285714286
x(&quot;Saturday&quot;)+x.rangeBand(); // 120</pre>
<h4>the range method</h4>
<p>Finally, we can also use the .range method with several values.<br />
We can specify the domain, or not. Then, if we use such a scale on a value which is not part of the domain (or if the domain is left empty), this value is added to the domain. If there are <em>n</em> values in the range, and more in the domain, then the n+1<sup>th</sup> value of the doamin is matched with the 1st value in the range, etc.</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">var x=d3.scale.ordinal().range([&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;]); 
x.domain(); // [] - empty still.
x(0); // &quot;hello&quot;
x(1); // &quot;world&quot;
x(2); // &quot;hello&quot;
x.domain(); // [0,1,2]
</pre>
<h4>Color palettes</h4>
<p><strong>Unlike in protovis</strong>, which had them under pv.Colors &#8211; i.e. pv.Colors.category10(), in d3, built-in color palettes can be accessed through scales. Well, even in protovis they had been ordinal scales all along, only not called this way.<br />
There are <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Ordinal-Scales#category10">4 built-in color palette</a> in protovis: d3.scale.category10(), d3.scale.category20(), d3.scale.category20b(), and d3.scale.category20c().</p>
<p>A palette like d3.scale.category10() works exactly like an ordinal scale. </p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">
var p=d3.scale.category10();
var r=p.range(); // [&quot;#1f77b4&quot;, &quot;#ff7f0e&quot;, &quot;#2ca02c&quot;, &quot;#d62728&quot;, &quot;#9467bd&quot;, 
                      // &quot;#8c564b&quot;, &quot;#e377c2&quot;, &quot;#7f7f7f&quot;, &quot;#bcbd22&quot;, &quot;#17becf&quot;]
var s=d3.scale.ordinal().range(r); 
p.domain(); // [] - empty
s.domain(); // [] - empty, see above
p(0); // &quot;#1f77b4&quot;
p(1); // &quot;#ff7f0e&quot;
p(2); // &quot;#2ca02c&quot;
p.domain(); // [0,1,2];
s(0); // &quot;#1f77b4&quot;
s(1); // &quot;#ff7f0e&quot;
s(2); // &quot;#2ca02c&quot;
s.domain(); // [0,1,2];</pre>
<p>It&#8217;s noteworthy that in d3, color palette return strings, not pv.Color objects like in protovis.<br />
Also: </p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">
d3.scale.category10(1); // this doesn't work
d3.scale.category10()(1); // this is the way.</pre>
<h2>Colors</h2>
<p>Compared to protovis, d3.color is simpler. The main reason is that protovis handled color and transparency together with the pv.Color object, whereas in SVG, those two are distinct attributes: you handle the background color of a filled object with <em>fill</em>, its transparency with <em>opacity</em>, the color of the outline with <em>stroke</em> and the transparency of that color with <em>stroke-opacity</em>. </p>
<p>d3 has two color objects: d3_Rgb and d3_Hsl, which describe colors in the two of the most popular color spaces: red/green/blue, and hue/saturation/light. </p>
<p>With d3.color, you can make operations on such objects, like converting colors between various formats, or make colors lighter or darker.</p>
<p>d3.rgb(<em>color</em>), and d3.hsl(<em>color</em>) create such objects.<br />
In this context, <em>color</em> can be (straight from <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Colors">the manual</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>rgb decimal &#8211; &#8220;rgb(255,255,255)&#8221;</li>
<li>hsl decimal &#8211; &#8220;hsl(120,50%,20%)&#8221;</li>
<li>rgb hexadecimal &#8211; &#8220;#ffeeaa&#8221;</li>
<li>rgb shorthand hexadecimal &#8211; &#8220;#fea&#8221;</li>
<li>named &#8211; &#8220;red&#8221;, &#8220;white&#8221;, &#8220;blue&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have that object, you can make it brighter or darker with the appropriate method.<br />
You can use .toString() to get it back in rgb hexadecimal format (or hsl decimal), and .rgb() or .hsl() to convert it to the object in the other color space. </p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">
var c=d3.rgb(&quot;violet&quot;) // d3_Rgb object
c.toString(); // &quot;#ee82ee&quot;
c.darker().toString(); // &quot;#a65ba6&quot;
c.darker(2).toString(); // &quot;#743f74&quot; - even darker
c.brighter().toString();// &quot;ffb9ff&quot;
c.brighter(0.1).toString(); // &quot;#f686f6&quot; - only slightly brighter
c.hsl(); // d3_Hsl object
c.hsl().toString() // &quot;hsl(300, 76, 72)&quot;</pre>

		<h2>From data to graphics</h2>
<p><img src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/d3principle.png" alt="the d3 principle (and also the protovis principle)" /><br />
d3 and protovis are built around the same principle. Take data, put it into an array, and for each element of data a graphical object can be created, whose properties are derived from the data that was provided.</p>
<p>Only d3 and protovis have a slightly different way of adding those graphical elements and getting data. </p>
<p>In protovis, you start from a panel, a protovis-specific object, to which you add various marks. Each time you add a mark, you can either:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>not</strong> specify data and add just one, </li>
<li> or <strong>specify</strong> data and create as many as there are items in the array you pass as data.</li>
</ul>
<p>.</p>
<h2>How de did it in protovis</h2>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">
var vis=new pv.Panel().width(200).height(200); 
vis.add(pv.Panel).top(10).left(10)
  .add(pv.Bar)
    .data([1,4,3,2,5])
    .left(function() {return this.index*20;})
    .width(15)
    .bottom(0)
    .height(function(d) {return d*10;});
vis.render();</pre>
<p><img src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/protoBar.png" alt="this simple bar chart in protovis" /><br />
you first create a panel (first line), you may add an element without data (here, another panel, line 2), and add to this panel bars: there would be 5, one for each element in the array in line 4. </p>
<h2>And in d3?</h2>
<p>In d3, you also have a way to add either one object without passing data, or a series of objects &#8211; one per data element. </p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">
var vis=d3.select(&quot;body&quot;).append(&quot;svg:svg&quot;).attr(&quot;width&quot;,200).attr(&quot;height&quot;,200);
var rect=vis.selectAll(&quot;rect&quot;).data([1,4,3,2,5]).enter().append(&quot;svg:rect&quot;);
rect.attr(&quot;height&quot;,function(d) {return d*20;})
  .attr(&quot;width&quot;, 15)
  .attr(&quot;x&quot;,function(d,i) {return i*20;})
  .attr(&quot;y&quot;,function(d) {return 100-20*d;}
  .attr(&quot;fill&quot;,&quot;steelblue&quot;);
</pre>
<p>In the first line, we are creating an svg document which will be the root of our graphical creation. It behaves just as the top-level panel in protovis. </p>
<p>However we are not creating this out of thin air, but rather we are bolting it onto an existing part of the page, here the <body> tag. Essentially, we are looking through the page for a tag named <body> and once we find it (which should be the case often), that&#8217;s where we put the svg document. </p>
<p>Oftentimes, instead of creating our document on <body>, we are going to add it to an existing &lt;div&gt; block, for instance: </p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">
&lt;div id=&quot;chart&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
var vis=d3.select(&quot;#chart&quot;).append(&quot;svg:svg&quot;);
...
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p>Anyway. To <strong>add one element</strong>, regardless of data, what you do is: </p>
<p>The logic is : d3.select(<em>where we would like to put our new object</em>).append(<em>type of new object</em>).</p>
<p>Going back to our code: </p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">
var vis=d3.select(&quot;body&quot;).append(&quot;svg:svg&quot;).attr(&quot;width&quot;,200).attr(&quot;height&quot;,200);
var rect=vis.selectAll(&quot;rect&quot;).data([1,4,3,2,5]).enter().append(&quot;svg:rect&quot;);
rect.attr(&quot;height&quot;,function(d) {return d*20;})
  .attr(&quot;width&quot;, 15)
  .attr(&quot;x&quot;,function(d,i) {return i*20;})
  .attr(&quot;y&quot;,function(d) {return 100-20*d;}
  .attr(&quot;fill&quot;,&quot;steelblue&quot;);
</pre>
<p>On line 2, we see a different construct:</p>
<p><em>an existing selection, or a part of the page</em><br />
.selectAll(<em>something</em>)<br />
.data(<em>an array</em>)<br />
.enter()<br />
.append(<em>an object type</em>)</p>
<p>This sequence of methods (selectAll, data, enter and append) are the way to add a series of elements. If all you need to know is to create a bar chart, just remember that, but if you plan on taking your d3 skills further than where you stopped with protovis, look at the end of the post for a more thorough explanation of the selection process. </p>
<h2>Attributes and accessor functions</h2>
<p>At this stage, we&#8217;ve added our new rectangles, and now we are going to shape and style them. </p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">rect.attr(&quot;height&quot;,function(d) {return d*20;})
  .attr(&quot;width&quot;, 15)
  .attr(&quot;x&quot;,function(d,i) {return i*20;})
  .attr(&quot;y&quot;,function(d) {return 100-20*d;}
  .attr(&quot;fill&quot;,&quot;steelblue&quot;);
</pre>
<p>All the attributes of a graphical element are controlled by the method attr(). You specify the attribute you want to set, and the value you want to give.<br />
In some cases, the value doesn&#8217;t depend on the data. All the bars will be 15 pixels wide, and they will all be of the steelblue color.<br />
In some others, the value do depend on the data. We decide that the height of each bar is 20 times the value of the underlying data, in pixels (so 1 becomes 20, 5 becomes 100 etc.). Like in protovis, once data has been attributed to an element, function(<em>variable name</em>) enables to return a dynamic value in function on that element. By convention, we usually write function(d) {&#8230;;} (d for data) although it could be anything. Those functions are still called <strong>accessor functions</strong>.<br />
so for instance: </p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">.attr(&quot;height&quot;,function(d) {return d*20;})</pre>
<p>means that the height will be 20 times the value of the underlying data element (exactly what we said above).<br />
In protovis, we could position the mark relatively to any corner of its parent, so we had a .top method and a .bottom method. But with SVG, objects are positioned relatively to the top-left corner. So when we specify the y position, it is also relative to the top of the document, not necessarily to the axis (and not in this case).<br />
so &#8211;
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">.attr(&quot;y&quot;, function(d) {return 100-d*20;})</pre>
<p>if we use scales (see next post), all of this will have no impact whatsoever anyway.<br />
Finally, there is an attribue here which doesn&#8217;t so much depend on the <em>value</em> of the data, but of its <em>rank</em> in the data items: the x position.<br />
for this, we write: function(d,i) {return i*20;}<br />
Here is a <strong>fundamental difference with protovis</strong>. In protovis, when we passed a second argument to such a function, it meant the data of the parent element (grand parent for the third, etc.). But here in d3, the second parameter is the position of the data element in its array. By convention, we write it i (for index).<br />
And since you have to know: there is no easy way to retrieve the data of the parent element. </p>
<h2>Bonus: understanding selections</h2>
<p>To add many elements at once we&#8217;ve used the sequence: selectAll, data, enter, append.<br />
Why use 4 methods for what appears to be one elementary task? If you don&#8217;t care about manipulating nodes individually, for instance for animations, you can just remember the sequence. But if you want to know more, here is what each method does. </p>
<h3>selectAll</h3>
<p><img src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/d3selectAll.png" alt="the selectAll method" /><br />
First, we select a point on which to add your new graphical objects. When you are creating your objects and use the selectAll method, it will return an <em>empty selection</em> but based on that given point. You may also use selectAll in another context, to update your objects for instance. But here, an empty selection is expected. </p>
<h3>data</h3>
<p><img src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/d3data.png" alt="the data method" /><br />
Then, you attribute data. This works quite similarly to protovis: d3 expects an array. d3 takes the concept further (with the concept of <em>data joins</em>) but you need not concern yourself with that until you look at transitions.<br />
Anyway, at this stage you have an empty selection, based on a given point in the page, but with data.</p>
<h3>enter</h3>
<p><img src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/d3enter.png" alt="the enter method" /><br />
The enter method updates the selection with nodes which have data, but no graphical representation. Using enter() is like creating stubs where the graphical elements will be grafted. </p>
<h3>append</h3>
<p><img src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/d3append.png" alt="the append method" /><br />
Finally, by appending we actually create the graphical objects. Each is tied to one data element, so it can be further styled (for instance, through &#8220;attr&#8221;) to derive its characteristics from the value of that data.</p>

    </header>
	<section class="post-content">

		<p>You&#8217;ve spent some time <a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/blog/2011/02/07/working-with-data-in-protovis/">learning protovis</a> only to find that its development is halted as authors have switched to work on <a href="http://www.d3-js.org/">d3</a>. Have your efforts all been in vain? Fear not! This series of posts will help you adapt to d3 with a protovis background. </p>
<p>Before we go anywhere further, let me say that <strong>these posts won&#8217;t make you awesome at d3</strong> (yet). We won&#8217;t be talking about how to do all amazing things you could never do in protovis. Rather, we&#8217;ll focus on enabling you to be as comfortable with d3 than you could have been with protovis. And once that&#8217;s done, nothing will prevent you from learning the more powerful aspects of d3. </p>
<p>Anyway, if you&#8217;re reading this, <strong>you are already awesome.</strong></p>
<h2>Why should I make the switch to d3?</h2>
<p>Frankly, you don&#8217;t have to. Protovis is a fine framework and works well. Now you may <em>want</em> to switch to d3 for several reasons. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>d3 is fast.</strong> d3 is better at handling scenes with hundreds or thousands of elements. So if you like scatterplots or network graphs, and who doesn&#8217;t, d3 has much stronger performance.</li>
<li><strong>d3 does animation.</strong> There were workarounds to get animation in protovis but there were that. Workarounds. Animation and transitions are built in d3 and are a snap to implement. </li>
<li><strong>More features.</strong> Just because development has stopped on protovis doesn&#8217;t mean that it has stopped elsewhere&#8230; for instance, d3 has <em>more ready-to-use layouts</em>, like voronoi tesselation or chords, and it has more methods and functions to make your life easier, to access and manipulate data for example.</li>
<li><strong>Styling.</strong> In d3 it is possible to apply style sheets in CSS to graphical elements. This helps keeping the code and the format separate. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Yes but doesn&#8217;t everything change?</h2>
<p>Short answer: <strong>no. </strong></p>
<p>Less short answer: some things do change substantially. Most things stay the same. And then, some things look the same but have changed.</p>
<h3>Things that stay the same</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The general principle.</strong>Protovis is about transforming an array of data into the same number of graphical elements, with characteristics derived from that data. d3 does exactly this as well.</li>
<li>pv.Nest, which in my personal protovis experience has been the hardest to understand. Only, it&#8217;s called d3.nest now. </li>
<li>Methods that supplement the existing javascript array manipulation methods, like pv.min, pv.values, pv.entries etc. are also back (as d3.min, d3.values, d3.entries, but you&#8217;ve guessed it by now). Some, like pv.mean or pv.median, didn&#8217;t make it through but you could easily rewrite them, or continue using the protovis ones.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Things that look different, but which are largely the same</h3>
<p>Protovis had a number of native graphical objects, or marks, that could be manipulated at will with methods. </p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">var vis=new pv.Panel()
  .height(400)
  .width(400)
  .fillStyle(&quot;aliceblue&quot;)
  .lineWidth(1)
  .strokeStyle(&quot;steelblue&quot;);
vis.render();</pre>
<p>In protovis, it is inherently different to set the height, the width or just any property of an object. This uses different methods. </p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">var vis=d3.select(&quot;body&quot;).append(&quot;svg:svg&quot;);
  vis.append(&quot;svg:rect&quot;)
    .attr(&quot;height&quot;,400)
    .attr(&quot;width&quot;,400)
    .attr(&quot;fill&quot;,&quot;aliceblue&quot;)
    .attr(&quot;stroke&quot;,&quot;steelblue&quot;)
    .attr(&quot;stroke-width&quot;,1);</pre>
<p>This produces essentially the same thing. We add a rectangle of a specified height, width, and colors. There are a few differences though. Here, controlling height, width or fill is essentially the same thing and uses the same method, .attr(). Notice also that we first created an svg document, then a shape within that document. And also, that we don&#8217;t need to use vis.render(); anymore. </p>
<p>The d3 approach looks longer. But if we define all the style information first we could make it much shorter, shorter than in protovis in fact!<br />
For instance:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">var vis=d3.select(&quot;body&quot;).append(&quot;svg:svg&quot;).append(&quot;svg:rect&quot;).attr(&quot;class&quot;, &quot;myRect&quot;);</pre>
<p>Much of the apparent differences between d3 and protovis come from using explicitly svg shapes (paths, polygons, ellipses, etc.) as opposed to native objects (pv.Panel, pv.Bar, pv.Dot, etc.), although &#8211; it&#8217;s essentially the same thing. Yes, you have to <a href="http://commons.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/SVG_Essentials">learn your SVG</a> but it&#8217;s really on a need-to-know basis. In fact, if you&#8217;ve worked with protovis, or even if you&#8217;ve worked with HTML and CSS, you probably know more SVG than you thought. </p>
<p>SVG is more flexible than protovis objects. The flipside is that constructs which were once simple in protovis become less obvious in SVG. But for those cases, d3 has recreated some native objects, even if not as many as in protovis. </p>
<h3>Things that look the same, but which are different</h3>
<p>There have been some changes in methods that have kept the same name since protovis &#8211; some minor, some more substantial. In any case, the basic ways of using these methods (like scale, color, data&#8230;) doesn&#8217;t change much. It&#8217;s only their more exotic uses who do change. </p>

Before I go and develop why, I&#8217;d like to say a few words about the author.</p>
<h3>Thank you Nathan!</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://directory.stat.ucla.edu/images/nathan-yau/1.jpg?1287095045" alt="" width="105" height="147" />Nathan started <a href="http://www.flowingdata.com/">flowingdata</a> in <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2007/06/25/creating-effective-visualization/">2007</a>. This wasn&#8217;t the first blog on data visualization, and his author wasn&#8217;t the best known member of this community. Maintaining the blog wasn&#8217;t (and still isn&#8217;t) his full-time occupation. Yet flowingdata rose to be the most read data visualization blog, thus making a huge service to us all, bringing this science much needed visibility.<br />
Nathan pulled this off by posting something everyday: original content, fine examples of visualizations, technological advances, tutorials, and so on.</p>
<p>As if that were not enough, the <a title="Job boards" href="http://forums.flowingdata.com/forum/finding-a-job">job boards</a> at flowingdata are an invaluable ressources for anyone who seeks to hire and infovis expert&#8230; and for experts themselves obviously.</p>
<p>So, for all of this: <strong>thank you Nathan!</strong></p>
<h3>Visualizing data or visualize this?</h3>
<p><a href="http://amzn.com/0596514557"><img class="alignleft" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fJLTeNinL._SL160_PIsitb-sticker-arrow-dp,TopRight,12,-18_SH30_OU01_AA160_.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="160" /></a>One of the first book I read on visualization was Visualizing Data by Ben Fry (not the equally interesting <a href="http://amzn.com/0963488406">Cleveland book of the same title</a>). Back then I wanted a generic book about good practices on visualization without getting my hands dirty with code. But Visualizing Data is really a book about <a href="http://www.processing.org/">processing</a>. This is both the greatest limitation and the greatest strength of this book, which will teach you processing through data examples. (I am never happier than in front of an empty processing sketch).</p>
<p>Visualize this!, by contrast, is more agnostic. It has the same ambition to help beginners get past the initial stumbling blocks of visualization, but with a greater variety of tools. Nathan&#8217;s favorite approach is to start with R then turn to Illustrator for the win. Yet he covers more tools such as python, protovis or flash.</p>
<p>Nathan doesn&#8217;t go very far into the nitty-gritty. Instead, he attempts to make those tools less intimidating, more approachable. Also and perhaps more importantly, the focus of the various chapters is to distill some good ideas and practices on top of the practical examples.</p>
<p>Which lead us to&#8230;</p>
<h3>Visualize this or Show me the Numbers?</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31ohzJBcb5L._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-arrow-click,TopRight,35,-76_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="210" /></p>
<p><strong>Show me the Numbers</strong> by Stephen Few is one the essential books on data visualization. I have <a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/blog/2010/02/10/making-data-meaningful-style-guide-on-the-presentation-of-statistics/">said </a> <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-data-visualization-books">many</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z9KCILF8UJIF">times</a> that if one should read only one book on charts and tables, it should be this. A few years after reading it, I find its recommendations to be a bit rigid (which its author is not).</p>
<p>For comparison&#8217;s sake, here is what Stephen says about pie charts.</p>
<blockquote><p>Speaking of &#8220;difficult to read&#8221;, allow me to declare with no further delay that <em>I don&#8217;t use pie charts, </em>and I strongly recommend that you abandon them as well. My reason is simple: pie charts communicate poorly. This is a fundamental problem with all types of area graphs but especially with pie charts. Our visual perception is not designed to accurately assign quantitative values to 2-D areas, and we have an even harder time when the third dimension of depth is added.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now here&#8217;s what Nathan has to say on the subject:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pie charts have developed a stigma for not being as accurate as bar charts or position-based visuals, so some think you should avoid them completely. It&#8217;s easier to judge length than it is to judge areas and angles. That doesn&#8217;t mean you have to completely avoid them though.</p>
<p>You can use the pie chart without any problems just as long as you know its limitations. It&#8217;s simple. Keep your data organized, and don&#8217;t put too many wedges on one pie.</p></blockquote>
<p>The above is fairly representative of the tone of the book, which is less directive, less scary perhaps, than other guides that have been written on the subject. Nathan will point you in the right direction, rather than force you to do things in a certain way (as an aside, the citation of Show me the Numbers is less representative of that book as it is the strongest-voiced recommendation).</p>
<h3>Wrapping up</h3>
<p>Once you close <strong>Visualize this!</strong> you won&#8217;t be a master of R. But you will be on the good track to become one if you choose to. If you know nothing about visualization it is a comforting way to start as it presents the field in an accessible way. This is arguably the first book to do so. If you know more on visualization there may be a thing for you. I knew nothing on Illustrator for instance, and I also learned things in the first and last chapters. I also appreaciated the more design-oriented approach compared to more technical books.</p>
<p>At the end of this month I will go on vacation. I will leave the book on my desk and it will disappear, like my favorite books on the subject before it. I might find who will have borrowed it from me, but not who will have borrowed it from them&#8230; What better fate can I hope for this book?</p></blockquote>

Last month, <a href="http://www.visualizing.org/">visualizing.org</a> organized an event in Brussels to gather European dataviz folks. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, the main output of that is that a handful of those present decided to create an informal discussion group to share ideas and promote data visualization. The group as it currently stands includes <a href="http://www.twitter.com/#!/datavis">@datavis</a> (@wiederkehr), <a href="http://www.twitter.com/#!/FILWD">@FILWD</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/#!/infosthetics">@infosthetics</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/#!/janwillemtulp">@janwillemtulp</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/#!/moritz_stefaner">@moritz_stefaner</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/#!/visualisingdata">@visualisingdata</a> and myself (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/#!/jcukier">@jcukier</a>).</p>
<p>Before going any further <strong>I invite you to follow any and all of these accounts</strong> you don&#8217;t yet follow on twitter. You would be in great company (see below).
</p>
<p>This week I was looking at the Twitter API and had the idea to compare our respective friends and followers on twitter. We have very different profiles.<br />
First, we are all based in a different country, except for @filwd and @moritz_stefaner who are both in Germany. Also the interest of our audiences are different. </p>
<p>Still, I was suprised to see that there was not that much overlap among our followers. For each of us, at least one third of our followers do not follow any of the other accounts. So, even for @infosthetics which has over 8000 followers, the collective audience of the group is approximately twice as much. </p>
<p><script src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/smallTreemap.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</p>
<p>So anyway, I conducted some further analysis to answer some questions such as: </p>
<ul>
<li>which accounts follow several of us, but not one specific account?</li>
<li>among the followers unique to an account, which have many followers? (ie @datavis is being followed, and occasionally RT&#8217;d, by @alyssa_milano!)
<li>which accounts are being followed by many of us?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/stuff/unum3.html">you can find the detail here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>So the 22 accounts that currently follow our 8 accounts are:<br />

		<p>This year I have participated to the <a href="http://hcil.cs.umd.edu/localphp/hcil/vast11/index.php/">VAST Challenge</a> (VAST stands for visual analytics science and technology). The VAST symposium is part of the yearly VisWeek conferences. </p>
<p>Anyway. The rules required contestants to send videos with voiceovers, so without further ado here they are. </p>

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMPZJLms9tU&#038;hd=1">Watch me in HD too!!</a></p>
<p>If you want to play with the tools you can download them here: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5259106/mc1.zip">mini-challenge 1</a>, <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5259106/mc3.zip">mini-challenge 3</a>. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I couldn&#8217;t find the time to complete mini-challenge 2 and the grand challenge. I&#8217;m making this on my free time and I had to balance all kinds of commitments, so I couldn&#8217;t secure enough time to finish. Unlike previous years, though, I managed to find enough time to start ! so, in the words of Charlie Sheen: winning.</p>
<p>So what is this about?<br />
In the fictional Vastopolis, a mysterious infection strikes. Where does it come from and how is this transmitted? To answer these questions we have one million tweets sent by residents in the past 3 weeks. and among that million, there are quite a few about people reporting symptoms. </p>
<p>The first thing that I did was coming up for a method to tell whether one tweet was actually about a disease or not. so I scored them. I made a list of words that were required to consider that one message related to sickness, they were fairly univoquial like sick, flu, pneumonia, etc. Each of those words added one point to a &#8220;sickness&#8221; score. Then there was a second list of more ambiguous words like &#8220;a lot&#8221;, &#8220;pain&#8221;, &#8220;fire&#8221; etc. I added one point for each of these words or phrase, if a message already contains a required word. So, there were a few false negative, a few false positive, but all in all it was fairly accurate. </p>
<p>Fairly soon I had the idea to show the sums of all the scores of a part of the map, rather than showing each individual tweet. But originally, the sectors were quite large and I showed data by day.<br />
 <a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/earlyshot.png"><img src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/earlyshot.png" alt="" title="earlyshot" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-931" /></a></p>
<p>Then, I worked with finer sectors and by 6 hours chunks. That&#8217;s how I could exhibit how people moved towards the center of the map by day, and back to its edges every night. With finer geographic details I could also see some spikes in various areas of the map during the period that I couldn&#8217;t see before, which were not necessarily related to the disease.</p>
<p><a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/nextshot.png"><img src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/nextshot.png" alt="" title="nextshot" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932" /></a></p>
<p>Eventually, I wanted to read what the tweets corresponded to, so I loaded the full text of the messages so that clicking on a square would reveal what was said at that moment. In this dataset, every spike in volume corresponds with an event that&#8217;s been added by the designers, so it was fun to discover everything happening there, from baseball games to accidents or buildings catching fire. Often, there were articles in the mini-challenge 3 dataset that would give more information about what really happened.</p>
<p>so, what was mini-challenge 3 about? nothing less than diagnosing possible terrorist threat. This time we were given not one million tweets, but thousands of articles which were much longer than 140 characters! From reading a few sample articles, I saw that most didn&#8217;t talk about terrorism or vastopolis at all. But couldn&#8217;t they contain clues that could link 2 and 2? </p>
<p>my first idea was to find all entities in the articles, that is names of people, or names of organizations (which follow a certain syntax) and arrange them in a network. The problem is that there were just too many names and groups (thousands of both) and I couldn&#8217;t tell from such a list which sounded suspicious. Although, a group called &#8220;network of hate&#8221; is probably not a charity. I&#8217;m sure it is possible to solve the challenge like this, but I chose another way to get my first leads.</p>
<p>I just did like in mini-challenge 1 and scored my articles, but I gave them several scores instead of just one by comparing them to several series of words. One series, for instance, was all the proper names in Vastopolis, like names of neighborhoods, because articles <em>about</em> Vastopolis are probably more interesting. The other series corresponded to various kind of threats. </p>
<p>That allowed me to create the scatterplot form which I used both to represent articles and to narrow the selection by selecting an area if needed. Then, as time went by I added more and more features to the tool, for instance an interface to read articles with keywords highlighted, the possibility to filter articles by keyword in addition to a graphical interface, being able to see all the articles as a list and select from that list, not just from the scatterplot, and finally the possiblity to mark articles as interesting and regroup them in another list&#8230;</p>
<p>That was about when I felt I could run out of time, so I didn&#8217;t add the other features I had planned or worked on making a decent interface. Also, I spent a lot of time not just trying to solve the challenge, but reading all the stories that were planted in the dataset, linking them to the tweets of MC1, etc. </p>
<p>Anyway. I quite enjoyed working on that and really, really appreciated the humongous work that went into creating the vast challenge universe. I&#8217;m looking forward seeing what other teams came up with. On a side note, it&#8217;s probably my last protovis projects as it makes sense to completely switch to D3 now&#8230;</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve been posting quite a few times on Tableau these last few days, so I&#8217;ll end up the week with one viz I had previously shared on twitter with some success.<br />

<div style="width:1667px;height:22px;padding:0px 10px 0px 0px;color:black;font:normal 8pt verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
<div style="float:right; padding-right:8px;"><a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/public?ref=http://public.tableausoftware.com/views/violette/Sheet1" target="_blank">Powered by Tableau</a></div>
</div>
<p>so what&#8217;s the story?<br />
I have been inspired to do this via the work on <a href="http://www.onformative.com/work/fragments-of-rgb/">onformative</a> which I discovered on <a href="http://butdoesitfloat.com/1420489/One-has-to-arrive-at-a-specific-temperature-at-which-the-objects">But does it float</a>.</p>
<p>I was struck by how the proximity of a red dot, a green dot and a blue dot was interpreted by our human eyes as a spot of another color. Then again, this is how <a href="http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/lcd5.htm">monitors</a> <a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/monitor7.htm">work</a>. If you look hard enough on your lcd screen you may see the sub-pixels.<br />
This is also why, in an image such as this one, the segments of the line appear unaligned, although logically this line is one pixel wide.<br />
<a href="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/unaligned.png"><img src="http://jckr.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/unaligned.png" alt="" title="unaligned" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926" /></a><br />
Physically, the segments are <em>indeed</em> unaligned, as the each segment uses sub-pixels of a different color which don&#8217;t have the same horizontal position within one pixel. </p>
<p>However, I didn&#8217;t realize that this effect would work with patches of blue, green and red much bigger than a subpixel.<br />
I made the underlying dataset from a picture of my daughter Violette when she was 2. I converted the picture to a list of values of red, green and blue (thanks, processing) which were all associated to a x and y position on the screen and the name of their layer (so they could be turned on or off). These x and y positions were derived from the position of the pixel on the original image, but the red, blue and green dots are all shifted in one direction so they form a triangle.<br />
Then, I&#8217;ve added some extra layers as noise to obfuscate the image. </p>
<p>Here, the effect is voluntary. Then again, if you position lots of marks one next to the other, you could re-create it accidentally, and instead of seeing three distinct dots, your users would see just one and of a different color at that!</p>
