<p>so here it is. I chose to compete on the <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/public/sites/default/files/Activity_Rates_and_Healthy_Living.xls">Activity Rates and Healthy Living</a> data set, because after downloading it I really enjoyed exploring it.</p>
<p>If the viz doesn&#8217;t show well in the blog, here&#8217;s a <a href="http://public.tableausoftware.com/views/contest/myDashboard">link to its page</a></p>
<p>My main reason for entering the <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/public/viz-contest">contest</a> is to be able to see what others have done. There are obviously many, many ways to tackle this and I am very much looking forward to see everyone&#8217;s work! my interactions with the Tableau community, especially through the forum, have always been very rewarding and what better way to learn than from example!</p>
<p>So for the fellow contestants that will see my work, here is my train of thoughts for the dashboard.</p>
<h3>The dataset</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m aware of USDA&#8217;s <a href="http://maps.ers.usda.gov/FoodAtlas/">food environment atlas</a>. It&#8217;s an application where people can see various food-related indicators on a map. The dataset we were handled is actually the background data of this. So, there is already a place where people can <em>consult </em>food indicators.</p>
<p>Now this beeing Tableau and all, I wanted to create an <em>analytical</em> dashboard where people could understand if and how the <em>input </em>variables affected the <em>output </em>variables.</p>
<p>The dataset consists mostly of <em>input </em>variables: various indicators that influence how healthy a local population is. That status (<em>output</em>) is expressed through a few variables, such as adult and child obesity rates and adult diabetes rates. Those variables are highly correlated with each other, so in my work I chose to focus on adult obesity rates which is the simplest one.</p>
<p>Now, inputs. The rest of the variables fall in several categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>income (median household income, poverty rates);</li>
<li>diet (consumption of various food items per capita);</li>
<li>shopping habits (for various types of stores or restaurants, the dataset would give their number and the money spent in each county, both in absolute numbers and per capita);</li>
<li>lifestyle information (data on households without cars and far from stores, on the physical activity level of the population, and the facilities offered by the state);</li>
<li>pricing variables (price ratios between some &#8220;healthy&#8221; food items and some less healthy, equivalent food items, for instance fruits vs. snacks; tax information on unhealthy food);</li>
<li>policy variables (measuring participation to various programmes such as SNAP or WIC); </li>
<li>socio-demographic variables (ethnic groups in population, &#8220;metro&#8221; status of county, whether the county was growing and shrinking, and voting preferences).</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, that&#8217;s a lot of variables (about 90, plus the county and state dimensions).</p>
<p>Oddly enough, there wasn&#8217;t a population measure in the dataset, and many indicators were available in absolute value only, so I constructed a proxy by dividing two variables on the same subject (something like &#8220;number of convenience stores&#8221; and &#8220;number of convenience stores / capita&#8221;).</p>
<p>That enabled me to build indicators per capita for all subjects, so I could see if they were correlated with my obesity rates.</p>
<h3>Findings &#8211; using Tableau desktop to make sense of the dataset</h3>
<p>The indicators which were most correlated with obesity were the income ones, which came as no surprise. All income indicators were also very correlated to each other. In the USA, <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/povdef.html#2">poverty</a> means having an income below a certain threshold which is defined at the <em>federal level</em>. But in other contexts, poverty is most often defined in relation to the median income (typically, a household is in poverty if its income is below half of the median income), so it can be used to measure inequality of a community, and <em>dispersion </em>of incomes.</p>
<p>As a result, many indicators appear to be correlated with obesity because they are not independent of income. This is the case for instance for most of the policy indicators: if a programme has many recipients in a county, it is because poverty is widespread, so residents are more likely to be affected by obesity. This makes it difficult to measure the impact of the programmes with this dataset. This is also the case, unfortunately, for racial indicators, as most of the counties with a very high black population have a low income.</p>
<p>Diet indicators also appear to be uncorrelated with obesity. This is counter-intuitive &#8211; isn&#8217;t eating vegetables or fresh farm produce the most certain way to prevent obesity? But one has to remember that this dataset is aggregated at the county level. Just because a county has a high level of, say, fruits consumption per capita doesn&#8217;t mean that every household is eating that much. Realistically, consumption will be very dispersed: the households where people cook, which are <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/jamie_oliver.html">less likely to be affected by obesity</a>, will buy all the fruits, and those where people don&#8217;t cook will simply buy none. Also, just because one buys more vegetable than average doesn&#8217;t mean they don&#8217;t also buy other, less recommended foodstuff.</p>
<p>The only diet indicator that appear to be somewhat correlated to obesity is the consumption of soft drinks.</p>
<p>When it comes to lifestyle habits, surprisingly, the proportion of households without car and living far from a store &#8211; people likely to walk more, so to be healthier &#8211; is positively correlated with obesity. This is because counties where this indicator is high are also poorer than average &#8211; again, income explains most of this. However, physical activity in general plays a positive role. States where people are most active, such as Colorado, enjoy the lowest obesity figures. In fact, all the counties with less than 15% of obesity are in Colorado.</p>
<p>Finally, pricing didn&#8217;t seem to have much impact on neither obesity, nor consumption. Why is that? Economists would call this &#8220;low price elasticity&#8221;, meaning that price changes do not encourage people to switch products and habits. But there is another explanation. Again, people who can&#8217;t cook are not going to buy green vegetables because they are cheaper. Also, consider the tax amount that are applied: no more than 7% in the most aggressive states. Compare that figure to the 400%+ levy that is applied to cigarettes in many countries of the world! Clearly, 4-7% is not strong enough to change habits. However, this money can be used to sponsor programmes that can help people adopt safer behaviors.</p>
<h3>What to show? making the visualization</h3>
<p>First, I wanted to show all of those findings. If 2 variables that you expect to be correlated (say, consumption of vegetables and obesity) are in fact not correlated, a point is made! But visually, nothing is less interesting than a scatterplot that doesn&#8217;t exhibit correlation. It&#8217;s just a stupid cloud of dots.</p>
<p>So instead I chose to focus on the correlations I could establish, namely: obesity and income, and obesity and activity. Those are the 2 lower scatterplot of my dashboard. I chose the poverty rate measure, because I&#8217;d rather have a trend line going up, than going down.</p>
<p>I duplicated that finding with a bar chart made with median income bins. For each bin (which represent all the counties where the median income fall in that range), I would plot the average obesity rate, and, miracle! this comes up as a markedly decreasing bar chart. Now, this figure doesn&#8217;t <em>establish </em>correlation, let alone causality, but it certainly <em>suggests </em>it more efficiently than a scatterplot. Also, it can be doubled as a navigation aide: clicking on a bar would highlight or select the relevant counties.</p>
<p>Finally, I decided to do a map. Well, actually, it was the first thing I had done, but  had second thoughts about it, and eventually I put it in. Why? first, to allow people to look up their county. Technically, my county is Travis county (Austin, TX) and I can find it easily on a map. Less so if I have to look for county names listed in order of any of their indicators. I added a quick filter on county name, for those who&#8217;d rather type than look up.</p>
<p>I also wanted to see whether there was a link between geography and obesity. So try the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where are the counties with obesity rates less than 15% ? Colorado only. </li>
<li>If we raise the threshold a little, we get San Francisco and New York. But until 20%, these counties remain very localized.</li>
<li>Likewise, virtually all counties above 35% are in the South &#8211; Alabama, Louisianne, Mississipi.</li>
</ul>
<p>Population also has an importance. The counties with a population above 1m people tend to have lower rates &#8211; their citizens also usually have higher incomes.</p>
<p>I decided to zoom the map on the lower 48 by default. It is possible to zoom out to see Alaska and Hawaii, but I don&#8217;t think that the advantage of seeing them all the time is greater than the inconvenient of having a smaller view point even if they are not necessary.</p>
<p>Regarding the marks. Originally, I didn&#8217;t assign any variable to their size, but then thought that the larger counties (i.e. LA, Harris (Houston), Cook (Chicago) &#8230;) were underrepresented. So I assigned my population proxy to size. But then, the density of the marks competed with the intensity of the color, which was attributed to the obesity rate. So I removed that and chose a size so that marks wouldn&#8217;t overlap each other too much. Regarding color, I wasn&#8217;t happy with the default scale. If I let it as is, it would consider that 12.5%, the minimum value of the dataset, is an extremely low number. But in absolute terms, it&#8217;s not. Most developed countries have obesity rates lower than that value at the national level. Japan or Korea are <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/538537864717">below 4%</a>. So I made the scale start at 0. But I didn&#8217;t like the output: the counties with the highest values didn&#8217;t stand out. Eventually, I chose a diverging scale, which helped counties with high and low values to be more visible.</p>
<p>I edited an tooltip card for the view. In another version of the dashboard, I had a sheet with numbers written out that would change depending on which country was last brushed. I like the idea that this information can stay on. But I got confused in the configuration of the actions, and couldn&#8217;t completely prevent the filter that applied to this sheet to be disabled, sometimes, which caused number for all counties to overlap, and an annoying downtime as that happens. So I made an tooltipinstead. Anyway, it&#8217;s easier to format text like this. But the problem is that it can hide a good portion of the dashboard. So I exercised constraint and only chose what I found the 15 or so most relevant variables.</p>
<p>Voilà! that&#8217; s it. I hope you like my dashboard, and I look forward to see the work of others! If you are a contestant, please leave a link to your entry in the comments. Good luck to all!!</p>

Introducing <a href="http://bit.ly/mdm-2">Making Data Meaningful Part 2 &#8211; Style guide on the presentation of statistics</a> &#8211; which, as its name cleverly suggests, is a compilation of  advice to present graphical information.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a follow up to <a href="/author/jerome/page/10/www.unece.org/stats/documents/writing/">Making Data Meaningul part 1</a> , which focused on <em>writing </em>about data, as opposed to visualize it.</p>
<p>The book is a cooperation between representatives of national statistical offices and intergovernmental organizations &#8211; all public statisticians, if you will. I hope it will help others to communicate their data better. Personally, I have written the part about charts and collaborated to some other chapters. But if I could sum up my advice in one sentence, it would be: go buy <a href="http://www.perceptualedge.com/">Stephen Few</a> books. Start with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Show-Me-Numbers-Designing-Enlighten/dp/0970601999/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1265820159&amp;sr=8-1">Show me the numbers.</a></p>
<p>The list of people who collaborated to the book includes:</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/?p=313">Yesterday&#8217;s post</a> on <a href="http://public.tableausoftware.com/">Tableau Public </a> generated a surge of traffic so I thought I should add more examples and practical information for people interested in the software.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick one on health, based on <a href="http://www.oecdilibrary.org/content/book/health_glance-2009-en">OECD Health at a Glance</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://publicbeta.tableausoftware.com/views/Health/Correlations"><img src="http://publicbeta.tableausoftware.com/static/images/Health-Correlations_rss.png" alt="click to interact" width="600" height="331" /></a></p>
<p>Just select two indicators, and you see how one influences the other. Or rather, is correlated because correlation doesn&#8217;t imply causation!</p>
<p>Here are links to more example done with Tableau Public.<br /> <a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/unesco.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-335" title="unesco" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/unesco.jpg" alt="" width="120" height="128" /></a><br /> Another Paris-based intergovernmental organisation is using Tableau &#8211; the <a href="http://www.unesco.org/en/efareport/dme/">UNESCO</a>.</p>
<p>These 2 have been done by <a href="http://www.paho.org/">PAHO</a> to describe the situation in Haiti (the 2nd is really powered by Tableau Server, but it&#8217;s close enough)<br /> <a href="http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=511&amp;Itemid=1864"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-337" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" title="HaitiPAHO1" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/HaitiPAHO1.png" alt="" width="128" height="128" /></a><a href="http://ais.paho.org/phip/viz/haiti_healthfacilities.asp"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-336" title="HaitiPAHO2" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/HaitiPAHO2.png" alt="" width="128" height="128" /></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are further examples on the<a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/blog/"> Tableau blog.</a></p>
<p>Now more about Tableau Public and the Beta.</p>
<p>Tableau Public doesn&#8217;t exactly allow you to do everything that Tableau does <em>from </em>the web. To prepare the views which are going to be published on the web, you need to use a software that runs on your computer.  It lets you do whatever you can do with the regular Tableau Desktop, with a couple of limitations: you have to stick to basic source file types (access, excel, and text file, no exotic database) and you are limited to 100,000 records of data. One other difference with the regular Tableau Desktop  is that you can&#8217;t save your work locally: you have to save it on the web, in your private space on Tableau servers. However, there are the same analytical and visual features in Tableau Public than in Tableau Desktop.</p>
<p>When your work is published, users don&#8217;t have access to all the tools you had when creating the view: they can&#8217;t move dimensions around, create exotic filters or calculations. They really see the chart as you intended it to be seen. There are a certain number of interactions built-in, however: users can select, highlight, sort and filter. If you are publishing a dashboard, the different tables and charts of the dashboard can be linked, meaning that an action (such as highlighting one dimension) in one place will be replicated elsewhere, or not. The underlying data can also be downloaded. So there is a great deal of interactivity, but not enough to twist your display beyond recognition. That being said, other Tableau Public users can download your workbook and manipulate it with the client software.</p>
<p>About the Beta: currently, Tableau Public is in closed beta. It will be in open Beta in February, as far as I know. To get a spot in the close beta, you need to write to the people of Tableau.</p>

		<p>I am currently beta testing <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/">Tableau</a> Public. Essentially <a href="http://public.tableausoftware.com/">Tableau Public</a> let you bring the power of <a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/?p=194">Tableau</a> analysis online. With Tableau public, your audience doesn&#8217;t need to download a workbook file that they can see in an offline, software client &#8211; they can see and interact with your work directly on a web page.</p>
<p>There are quite a few examples of the things you can do with Tableau public. These are the examples you are given when you start the product:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.freakalytics.com/2009/06/30/historic-stock-market-returns-exploring-insightful-metrics-with-tableau-online/"><img class="size-full wp-image-317" title="Tracking Economic Indicators by Freakalytics" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Freakalytics1.png" alt="Tracking Economic Indicators by Freakalytics" width="127" height="92" /></a><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2009/08/25/how-long-does-it-take-to-build-a-technology-empire/"><img class="size-full wp-image-315" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" title="A Tale of 100 Entrepreneurs by Christian Chabot" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Chabot1.png" alt="A Tale of 100 Entrepreneurs by Christian Chabot" width="127" height="92" /></a><a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Snarge1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-314" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" title="Bird strikes by airport by Crankyflier" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Snarge1.png" alt="Bird strikes by airport by Crankyflier" width="127" height="92" /></a><a href="http://fantasynews.cbssports.com/fantasyfootball/story/12157942"><img class="size-full wp-image-316" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; " title="Interactive Running Back Selector by CBS sports" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Eisenberg1.png" alt="Interactive Running Back Selector by CBS sports" width="127" height="92" /></a></p>
<p style="clear:left;">And there are always more on <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/community/blog">Tableau&#8217;s own blog</a>. I&#8217;ve done <a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/?p=295">quite a few</a> which I&#8217;ll share progressively on this blog and on my OECD blog, <a href="http://www.oecd.blog/statistics/factblog">http://www.oecd.blog/statistics/factblog</a>.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s the context. What&#8217;s the verdict?</p>
<h2><strong>1. There is no comparable data visualization platform out there.</strong></h2>
<p>There are many ways to communicate data visually. Count them: <a href="http://www.datavisualization.ch/tools/13-javascript-libraries-for-visualizations">13</a>, <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/javascript/20-fresh-javascript-data-visualization-libraries/">20</a>, <a href="http://theresaneil.wordpress.com/2009/12/06/28_rich_charting_tools/">28</a>, <a href="http://www.tripwiremagazine.com/2009/12/70-tools-for-visualizing-your-data-css-flash-jquery-php.html">75</a>&#8230; and many more.</p>
<p>However these tools have a narrower focus than Tableau, or require the user some programming ability. For instance, <a href="http://www.many-eyes.com/">Many Eyes</a> uses a certain number of types of data visualization which can be set up in seconds, but which cannot be customized. Conversely, <a href="http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/">Protovis</a> is very flexible but requires some knowledge of Javascript. And even for a skilled developer, coding an interactive data visualization from scratch takes time.</p>
<p>By contrast, <strong>Tableau is a fully-featured solution which doesn&#8217;t require programming</strong>. It has many representation types which can be deeply customized: every visual characteristic of a chart (colour, size, position, etc.) can depend on your data. Several charts can also be combined as one dashboard. On top of that, data visualization done in Tableau comes with many built-in controls, with an interface to highlight and filter data, or to get more details on demand. For dashboards, it is also possible to link charts, so that actions done on one chart (highlighting records, for instance) affect other charts.</p>
<h2><strong>2. The solution is not limitless. </strong></h2>
<p>Tableau enables you to do things which are not possible using other packages. But it doesn&#8217;t allow you to do anything. That&#8217;s for your own good &#8211; it won&#8217;t allow you to do things that don&#8217;t make sense.</p>
<p><strong>There are many safety nets in Tableau</strong>, which you may or may not run into. For instance, you can&#8217;t make a line chart for data which don&#8217;t have a temporal dimension &#8211; so much for parallel coordinates. However, the system is not fool-proof. Manipulating aggregates, for instance, can lead to errors that you wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about in plain old Excel, where the various steps through which data are computed to create a graph are more transparent (and more manual). Compared to Excel, you have to worry less about formatting &#8211; the default options for colours, fonts and positions are sterling &#8211; and be more vigilant about calculations.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Strength is in numbers.</strong></h2>
<p>Over the years, many of us grew frustrated with Excel visual capacities. <a href="http://peltiertech.com/">Others </a><a href="http://www.ozgrid.com/">firmly </a><a href="http://chandoo.org/wp/">believed </a>that anything could be done with the venerable spreadsheet and have shown the world that nothing is impossible.</p>
<p>The same applies to Tableau. <strong>The vibrant </strong><a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/community/forums"><strong>Tableau community</strong></a><strong> provides excellent advice</strong>. &#8220;Historic&#8221; Tableau users are not only proficient with the tool, but also have a better knowledge of data visualization practices than the average Excel user. Like any fully-featured product, there is a learning curve to Tableau, which means that there are experts (the proper in-house term is <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/learning/training/ondemand">Jedis</a>) which find hacks to make Tableau even more versatile. So of course, it is possible to do <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/forum/parallel-coordinates-plot">parallel coordinates with Tableau</a>.</p>
<p>The forum, like the abundant training, available as videos, manuals, list of tips,or online sessions with an instructor, doesn&#8217;t only help the user to solve their problems, but it also a fantastic source of inspiration.</p>
<p>With the introduction of Tableau Public, the forum will become even more helpful, as there will be more questions, more problems and more examples.</p>

		<p>In the last days of 2009, <a title="the cost of care - large version" href="http://blogs.ngm.com/.a/6a00e0098226918833012876a6070f970c-800wi">this chart</a> has been published by the <a href="http://blogs.ngm.com/blog_central/2009/12/the-cost-of-care.html">National Geographic blog</a>:<br />
<a title="Click for a large version" href="http://blogs.ngm.com/.a/6a00e0098226918833012876a6070f970c-800wi" target="_blank"><img src="http://blogs.ngm.com/.a/6a00e00982269188330120a76420ea970b-500wi" alt="the cost of care" /></a></p>
<p>The chart has since been debated and criticized, among others, by <a href="http://peltiertech.com/WordPress/graphing-the-cost-of-health-care/">Jon Peltier</a>, <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2009/12/not_the_best_ti.html">Andrew Gelman</a>, and <a href="http://www.seefirstblog.com/2009/12/25/warning-graphic-politics/">Evan Falchuk</a> &#8211; which all made valid points. For instance, to show correlation and outliers, a scatterplot does a much better job. That being said, it&#8217;s difficult to see the country names with a scatterplot. On the substance, the number of doctor visits is not the most relevant variable to bring into this picture, mostly because this number directly depends on the compensation mode of these doctors, not on their efficiency. The notion of &#8220;universal coverage&#8221; is also quite arbitrary. France, for instance, which had what could be called universal coverage since 1945, got an even more &#8220;universal&#8221; one in 2000. And still, some people can&#8217;t receive the healthcare they need.</p>
<p>The chart is based on OECD data, from a recently released book: <a title="OECD Health at a Glance" href="/author/jerome/page/10/bit.ly/51WhJL">OECD Health at a Glance</a>.  For the release of the book, I had worked on 2 presentations, which we remained unpublished. Since they were not formerly published by OECD the standard disclaimer apply &#8211; they do not commit the organization and do not necessarily represent its point of view and that of its members.</p>
<p>Anyway, for anyone interested in health statistics in general and in USA healthcare specifically, here they are in their slideshare glory:</p>

    </header>
	<section class="post-content">

		<p>Last month I saw <a href="http://www.ge.com/visualization/causes/">this infographic chart</a> put together by GE and GOOD magazine: <img src="http://files.gecompany.com//healthymagination/visualization/causes/causes_of_death_sm.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>While the look and feel is pleasing I was bothered by a few choices of design.</p>
<p>First, homicides and accidental deaths are not taken into account. I suspect that for some demographic categories, they represent a significant proportion of the deaths.</p>
<p>Second, the table doesn&#8217;t give an indication of the differences in mortality between the different age groups. For instance, there are over 15,000 deaths per 100,000 people over 85 years old, but only about 130 / 100,000 for young people aged  15-24. So the last item in the right-most column corresponds to much more deaths than the top item in the left-most column, although they have the same visual weight.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, I got to try <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/watermark">Tableau Public Beta</a> and thought it would be a good exercise to give it a spin.<br />
The data source is the same. I got my data through the <a href="http://wonder.cdc.gov/">wonder service</a> of the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/">CDC</a>.<br />
Here goes:</p>
<p><script type="text/javascript" src="http://public.tableausoftware.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js"></script><object class="tableauViz" width="604" height="643" style="display:none;"><param name="name" value="mortalitydata/Mortalitystatistics" /><param name="toolbar" value="yes" /></object><noscript>Mortality statistics <br /><a href="#"><img alt="Mortality statistics " src="http://public.tableausoftware.com/static/images/mortalitydata-Mortalitystatistics_rss.png" height="100%" /></a></noscript>
<div style="width:604px;height:22px;padding:3px 10px 0px 0px; color:black;font:normal 8pt verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
<div style="padding-left: 488px;"><a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/public?ref=http://public.tableausoftware.com/views/mortalitydata/Mortalitystatistics" target="_blank">Powered by Tableau</a></div>
</div>
<p>By playing with the filters you can see the ranking of the causes of death. For instance, we can see that accidents and homicide are precisely the leading causes of death of young people aged 20 to 24. Now what if you want to see the demographic categories that one given cause of death affects most? Here&#8217;s a second visualization: </p>
<p><script type="text/javascript" src="http://public.tableausoftware.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js"></script><object class="tableauViz" width="604" height="643" style="display:none;"><param name="name" value="mortalitydata/Deathdistribution" /><param name="toolbar" value="yes" /></object><noscript>Death distribution <br /><a href="#"><img alt="Death distribution " src="http://public.tableausoftware.com/static/images/mortalitydata-Deathdistribution_rss.png" height="100%" /></a></noscript>
<div style="width:604px;height:22px;padding:3px 10px 0px 0px; color:black;font:normal 8pt verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">
<div style="padding-left: 488px;"><a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/public?ref=http://public.tableausoftware.com/views/mortalitydata/Deathdistribution" target="_blank">Powered by Tableau</a></div>
</div>
<p>You can see that certain causes of death, for instance, only affect one gender or the other (such are certain forms of cancer).<br />
I&#8217;ve made that last one to illustrate the evolution of mortality with age. No one would be surprised to learn that older people have a higher probablity of dying but by what proportions?</p>

	<section class="post-content">

		<p>In the past couple of months, I have been busy maintaining a <a href="http://www.oecd.org/statistics/factblog">blog for OECD: Factblog</a>.</p>
<p>The idea is to illustrate topics on which we work by a chart which we&#8217;ll change regularly. So in order to do that, I&#8217;d have to be able to create charts of publishable quality.</p>
<h2>Excel screenshots: not a good option</h2>
<p>There are quite a few tools to create charts on the net. Despite this, the <em>de facto</em> standard is still a screenshot of Excel, a solution which is even used <a href="http://theappleblog.com/2009/12/18/iphone-and-ipod-touch-see-international-surge/">by the most reputable blogs.</a></p>
<p><div id="attachment_289" style="width: 605px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://theappleblog.com/2009/12/18/iphone-and-ipod-touch-see-international-surge/"><img class="size-full wp-image-289" title="excelinblog" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/excelinblog.png" alt="excelinblog" width="595" height="555" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This is taken from http://theappleblog.com/2009/12/18/iphone-and-ipod-touch-see-international-surge/</p></div></p>
<p><a href="http://theappleblog.com/2009/12/18/iphone-and-ipod-touch-see-international-surge/"></a>But alas, Excel is not fit for web publishing. First, you have to rely on Excel&#8217;s choice of colours and fonts, which won&#8217;t necessarily agree to those of your website. Second, you can&#8217;t control key characteristics of your output, such as its dimensions. And if your chart has to be resized, it will get pixelated. Clearly, there is a better way to do this.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_280" style="width: 671px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://theappleblog.com/2009/12/18/iphone-and-ipod-touch-see-international-surge/"><img class="size-full wp-image-280" title="pixellated" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/pixellated.png" alt="That's a detail of the chart on the link I showed above. The letters and the data bars are not as crisp as they could have been." width="661" height="387" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">That&#39;s a detail of the chart on the link I showed above. The letters and the data bars are not as crisp as they could have been.</p></div></p>
<h2>How about interactive charts?</h2>
<p>Then again, the most sensible way to present a chart on the web is by making it interactive. And there is no shortage of tools for that. But there are just as many issues.<br />
Some come from the content management system or blogging environment. Many CMS don&#8217;t allow you to use javascript and/or java and/or flash. So you&#8217;ll have to use a technology which is tolerated by your system.</p>
<p>Most javascript charting solutions rely on the &lt;CANVAS&gt; element.  Canvas is supported by most major browsers, with the exception of the Internet Explorer family. IE users still represent roughly 40% of the internet, but much more in the case of my OECD blog, so I can&#8217;t afford to use a non-IE friendly solution. There is at least one library which works well with IE, <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">RaphaelJS</a>.<br />
Using java cause two problems. First, the hiccup caused by the plug-in loading is enough to discourage some users. Second, it may not be understood well by readers:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_281" style="width: 574px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/java-reader.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-281" title="java reader" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/java-reader.png" alt="This is how one of my post reads in google reader. " width="564" height="323" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This is how one of my posts reads in google reader. </p></div></p>
<p>And it&#8217;s futile to believe that readers will read blogs from their home pages. So if all readers can&#8217;t show it well it&#8217;s a show-stopper.</p>
<h2>A tool to create good bitmap charts</h2>
<p>So, in a variety of situations the good old bitmap image is still the most appropriate thing to post. That&#8217;s why I created <a href="http://www.openprocessing.org/visuals/?visualID=6595">my own tools</a> with <a href="http://www.processing.org/">Processing</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/plotter-windows.zip">plotter windows</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/plotter-mac-OS-X.zip">plotter mac OS X</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/plotter-linux.zip">plotter linux</a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works.</p>
<p>when you unzip the files, you have a file called &#8220;mychart.txt&#8221; which is a set of parameters. Edit the file according to the instructions in &#8220;instructions.txt&#8221; to your liking, then launch the tool (plotter application). It will generate an image, called &#8220;mychart.png&#8221;.</p>
<p>The zip files contain the source code, which is also found here on <a href="http://www.openprocessing.org/visuals/?visualID=6595">my openprocessing account</a>.</p>
<p>With my tools, I wanted to address two things. First, I wanted to be able to create a chart and to have a precise control of all of its components, especially the size. In Excel, by contrast, it&#8217;s difficult to control the size of the plotting area, or the placement of the title &#8211; all of this things are done automatically and are difficult to correct (when it&#8217;s possible). Second, I wanted to be able to create functional thumbnails.</p>
<p>If you have to create smaller versions of a chart from a bigger image, the easiest solution is to resize the chart using an image editing software. But that&#8217;s what you&#8217;d get:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_282" style="width: 420px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/GDP-original.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-282" title="GDP original" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/GDP-original.png" alt="That's the original chart." width="410" height="320" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">That&#39;s the original chart.</p></div></p>
<p><div id="attachment_283" style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/GDP-resized.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-283" title="GDP resized" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/GDP-resized.png" alt="And that's the resized version. Legible? nah." width="250" height="180" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">And that&#39;s the resized version. Legible? nah.</p></div></p>
<p>But what if it were just as easy to re-render the chart in a smaller size, than to resize it with an external program? My tool can do that, too.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_285" style="width: 580px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/GDP-small1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-285" title="GDP small" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/GDP-small1.png" alt="Left: resized, right: re-rendered." width="570" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Left: resized, right: re-rendered.</p></div></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a gallery of various charts done with the tool. The tool supports: line charts, bar charts (both stacked and clustered), dots charts and area charts. No pie charts included. It&#8217;s best suited for simple charts with few series and relatively few data points.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_286" style="width: 420px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/example-1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-286" title="example 1" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/example-1.png" alt="Impact of energy subsidies on CO2 emissions" width="410" height="320" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Impact of energy subsidies on CO2 emissions</p></div></p>
<p><div id="attachment_287" style="width: 420px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/example-2.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-287" title="example 2" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/example-2.png" alt="Temperature and emission forecasts" width="410" height="320" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Temperature and emission forecasts</p></div></p>
<p><div id="attachment_288" style="width: 420px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/example-3.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-288" title="example 3" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/example-3.png" alt="Greenhouse gas emission projections" width="410" height="320" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Greenhouse gas emission projections</p></div></p>
<p>I hope you find it useful, tell me if you do and let me know if you find bugs.</p>

	<section class="post-content">

		<p>This Wednesday, I had the privilege of talking at <a href="http://vis.computer.org/VisWeek2009/">Visweek </a>at a panel with <a href="http://eagereyes.org/blog/2009/visweek-changing-the-world-with-visualization-panel">Robert Kosara</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/cps082/fall09/visitors/cohen.html">Sarah Cohen</a> and <a href="http://www.bewitched.com/">Martin Wattenberg</a>. That was a truly great experience (at least from that side of the microphone). We all had a different approach to the subject. Sarah showed some of the stories she ran on the Washington Post where showing data visually helped expose scandals and move things forward. Martin made insightful comparisons with writing &#8211; information verbalization. As for myself I elaborated on the OECD mantra that if people had better knowledge, they could make better decisions and that data visualization can help by providing the people that knowledge, without requiring them to actually know the data.</p>
<p>But as with panels, the most interesting part is always the discussion. And I was quite surprised to see where it was headed.</p>
<p>I have reserves in my belief that data visualization can save the world. For instance, I have been slightly disappointed by the outcome of the sunlight foundation <a href="http://www.sunlightlabs.com/contests/appsforamerica/">apps for America contest</a>. I thought the idea was fantastic and the finalist applications were very well designed, but not necessary useful. But I had read many positive reactions on blogs on this, or on anything related to data.gov, I thought I would be the skeptical one.</p>
<p>But during the panel, during the discussions and in the subsequent days, I really found myself in the opposite role. I think <strong>data </strong><strong>visualization can achieve much more than what we ask it to do!</strong></p>
<p>let&#8217;s put it this way. Currently there are approximately 1.7 billion internet users. That&#8217;s a order of magnitude of  the number of people that data visualization could help. Now before the before the panel, we had a talk about the number of visits that a successful data representation gets, and we convened that 100,000 viewers for one visualization is a lot. In other words, we still have <strong>more than 99.99% of the population to reach!</strong></p>
<p>True, we can use data visualization to inform better. But we can do more! use it to support decisions! couldn&#8217;t the subprime crisis have been avoided, for instance, if households were helped to make the right ones?</p>
<p>Raising the level of adoption of data visualization &#8211; not increasing it, but multiplying it &#8211; should really be a challenge of the field. However, academics seem to be more concerned with designing novel solutions which could turn into published papers. Then again, if public interest for data visualization was higher, funding would be more easily available to researchers.</p>
<p>As an aside, Excel has also been discussed. Is it the problem? Partly. If a data representation is not a canonical chart type in Excel, people are not aware it exists, and mainstream media or others with a long reach will not use it for fear that potential users may be confused. Even scatterplots, to Martin&#8217;s lament, although they are in Excel and that they are pretty straightforward to use and understand, generate that aura of fear.</p>
<p>Another comment which I really took to heart was the regret that while data visualization was thought to computer scientists, using data analytics isn&#8217;t tought in business schools. Wouldn&#8217;t it be part of the solution?</p>

	<section class="post-content">

		<p>If you are using computers for work, chances are that you are spending a good portion of your day with Microsoft products such as the Office suite. Some hate it, some love it, but to hundreds of millions it&#8217;s part of our daily lives and its design choices affect how we think and work in a much more profound way than we are aware of. So, the release of a new version of Office is always a significant event.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just installed Office 2010 and here are my first impressions.</p>
<h2>The UI is rationalized.</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_235" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/excel-2010.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-235" title="excel 2010" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/excel-2010.png" alt="excel 2010" width="600" height="552" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The UI is rationalized.</p></div></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>The interface will be familiar to Office 2007 users &#8211; they are <strong>still using the ribbon</strong>. Only a few buttons have been added to the applications I&#8217;ve tested, and the others have fortunately not moved since the previous version. However, the ribbon&#8217;s colours have been muted to a conservative white to grey gradient, which is <strong>much easier on the eyes</strong>. The added benefit is to make highlighted sections of the ribbon stand out much more efficiently.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_236" style="width: 808px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/excel-highlight.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-236" title="excel highlight" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/excel-highlight.png" alt="excel highlight" width="798" height="509" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Highlighting a section works much better against a sober gray than against a vivid blue.</p></div></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>The one button that changed was the<strong> top-left Office button</strong>. Frankly, what it was for was obvious to no-one in Office 2007. Due to its appearance, it wasn&#8217;t really clear that it was clickable, and the commands it gave access to were a mixed bunch &#8211; file control, program options, printing, document properties&#8230; which, before, were not in the same top-category.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_237" style="width: 646px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/office-backstage.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-237" title="office backstage" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/office-backstage.png" alt="This new area is called &quot;Office backstage&quot; and is a welcome change to the akward &quot;file&quot; menu or office button from previous versions." width="636" height="553" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This new area is called &quot;Office backstage&quot; and is a welcome change to the akward &quot;file&quot; menu or office button from previous versions.</p></div></p>
<p>In Office 2010, the Office button is still there, but this time, it looks like a button and is much more inviting. This time, it presents the user with the various commands on a separate screen. That way, commands are well-categorized, and there is ample space for UI designers to explain those commands which are not clear. This had not been possible when all those commands were forced to fit in one tiny menu.</p>
<p>Another thing that jumped at me when I started manipulating the programs were the <strong>improvement in the copy/paste interface</strong>. It&#8217;s fair to say that pasting has always been a very time-consuming task. It had never been easy, for instance, to paste values only or to keep source formatting, without having to open menus and choose options which require time and effort. Besides, some pasting options descriptions are cryptic and a bit daunting, so novice users aren&#8217;t encouraged to use them for fear of what might happen.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_238" style="width: 547px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/paste1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-238" title="paste1" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/paste1.png" alt="I've been using Excel for about 15 years so I know my way around. But improvement in the paste interface directly translates into productivity gains." width="537" height="491" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I&#39;ve been using Excel for about 15 years so I know my way around. But improvement in the paste interface directly translates into productivity gains.</p></div></p>
<p>Now the various pasting options are promoted within the contextual menu &#8211; they are big icons, and it is possible to preview how pasted material would look before pasting. The best part is that these commands are now accessible via native keyboard shortcuts, so we no longer need a string of 4 mouse clicks, or having to key in <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">alt+E, V, S,  enter</span> alt + H, V, S, V, enter in sequence. After a normal paste (ctrl +V) you can hold control and choose a one key option, such as V for values, T for transposing, etc. Much better.</p>
<h2>Changes in the Excel chart engine</h2>
<p>There are 3 ways in Excel to represent numbers graphically: charts proper, pivot charts and sparklines.</p>
<p><strong>Charts </strong>and pivot Charts<strong> didn&#8217;t see much improvement</strong> since the previous version of Excel. The formatting options move along in the direction initiated by Excel 2007: in addition to the controversed 3-D format set of options, users now have an advanced &#8220;shadow&#8221; and &#8220;glow and soft edges&#8221; submenus to spice up their charts. The interface for designing gradient fills has been upgraded. The underlying functionality remains unchanged but it is now easier to control. However, the pattern fill option returns, which is great news for people who print their graphs in B&amp;W.</p>

<p><strong>Sparklines are the real innovation of Excel 2010</strong>. Sparklines are a minimalist genre of chart that has been designed to fit in the regular flow of the text &#8211; they don&#8217;t require more space to be legible and efficient. While sparklines do not allow a user to look up the value of a specific data point, they are very efficient for communicating a trend. As such, they are increasingly used in dashboards and reports. There has been 3rd-party solutions to implement them in Excel but this native implementation is robust and well done. This will put sparklines on the radar for the great number of people who didn&#8217;t use them because they were not aware of their existence.</p>

<h2>Changes in other applications</h2>
<p><strong>Word </strong>has advanced options for opentype fonts, for instance, if your font has several character sets, you can now access them from Word. This is especially good for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjhDWAXlAII">distressed fonts</a> or the excessively ornate ones. In addition to kerning, it is now possible to control ligatures (i.e. to allow users to specify how ff, fl or fi would appear on screen, as one unique glyph or as two separated letters). Another new feature of Word is an advanced spell checker who is able to warn you of possible word choice errors, when using homonyms for instance.</p>
<p>On my setup, these 3 options didn&#8217;t really work, but it&#8217;s a beta and I understand the intent.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_241" style="width: 553px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/word-spelling-ko.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-241" title="word spelling ko" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/word-spelling-ko.png" alt="The advanced spell checker didn't catch those words which were quite obviously used out of context." width="543" height="550" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The advanced spell checker didn&#39;t catch those words which were quite obviously used out of context.</p></div></p>
<p><div id="attachment_242" style="width: 553px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/word-spelling-ok.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-242" title="word spelling ok" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/word-spelling-ok.png" alt="In French, it picked sides in a famous spelling controversy.

<p><strong>Powerpoint</strong> features 3 high-level changes: the possibility to structure a long presentation using sections, which somehow helps. However, as far as I could see, sections are only a grouping feature. There are few operations that can be performed on the section as a whole (as opposed to on all the presentation, or on each slide separately). For some tasks, you can think it is the case (as selecting the section implicitly selects its slides) but you&#8217;ll see that the operation only affected the current slide. Hmm. It can be useful to manage a presentation after it&#8217;s done, but IMO this will reduce the amount of time people spend designing their presentation <span style="text-decoration: underline;">away</span> from powerpoint which is ultimately a bad thing.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_243" style="width: 622px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/ppnt-sections.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-243" title="ppnt sections" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/ppnt-sections.png" alt="Powerpoint sections make it easier to manage very long documents." width="612" height="637" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Powerpoint sections make it easier to manage very long documents.</p></div></p>
<p>Powerpoint 2010 also features 3D transitions not unlike those of Keynote &#8217;08. It is also possible to include movie clips in presentation. Wasn&#8217;t this already the case? Previously, you&#8217;d have to embed video <em>files </em>in your presentations. Now it is possible to embed online videos as well. I&#8217;m not quite sure about these two options really, the first one for ideologic reasons, the 2nd because I wouldn&#8217;t recommend any speaker to rely overly on an internet connection and a video hosting service during a live presentation.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_244" style="width: 621px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/ppnt-insert-screenshot.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-244" title="ppnt insert screenshot" src="http://www.jeromecukier.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/ppnt-insert-screenshot.png" alt="The insert screenshot shows a gallery from all my open windows to choose from. The screen clipping tool allows one to insert only a section of the window. Neat!" width="611" height="637" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The insert screenshot shows a gallery from all my open windows to choose from. The screen clipping tool allows one to insert only a section of the window. Neat!</p></div></p>
<p>There&#8217;s another thing available everywhere in Office but which is possibly most useful in powerpoint, that is, insert screenshot. By clicking on this button, you have a list of thumbnails of all your open windows to choose from, this really reduces the hassle of using a screen capture tool, or worse, to manually do a screen capture, paste it in an image editing program, crop the image, save it to an acceptable format and copy/paste it again where you need it. It is possible to only copy part of these screens, too. It&#8217; s quite well done.</p>
<h2>Overall impressions</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m impressed with the thinking that went into the interface. The ribbon was already a great demonstration of out-of-the-box thinking and looked great on paper. I wasn&#8217;t thrilled to use it as the commands I had been using for some 15 years were not always easily found, but it seems that first-time users of Office 2007 outweight those who&#8217;ve used previous versions. The execution of the ribbon in Office 2010 is improved, and the team allowed themselves to go beyond some arbitrary constraints they had imposed to themselves, such as the pasting options or the office button. Well done.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy that sparklines have been added to Excel. In the next few years, we&#8217;ll find even better usage for them. However, I&#8217;m disappointed that the charting options remain essentially unchanged. Take the pie chart for instance. Everyone is aware of its limitations. There are many alternatives which would be easy to implement in Excel. Also, I&#8217;m disappointed that the charting mechanism remains the same: present the user with a long list of chart types, without supporting their reasoning in the choice of one over the other. There should be a chart wizard that would ask the user what do they want to show with the data and suggests the best choice (and not many possible choices) of chart.</p>
<p>I am not sure about the improved spell checker. Improved means increased dependency on the tool, which is the reason why typos haven&#8217;t been eradicated despite the technology.</p>
<p>I am very skeptical about all the advances of the Office product into design. Office users are not designers. Or rather, to be a designer requires a specific form of critical reasoning, not a new tool. More sophisticated graphical options allow novice users to achieve complex results without going through that phase of reasoning, which ultimately won&#8217;t help them.</p>
