		<description><![CDATA[Hi Firat, how are you?
are you referring to the view with dots, or that one with bars? I have a very low-end machine which handles the bars quite well but which chokes on the dots. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a good idea to show individual dots, though...
for this view here x is the position in km from the start, the darker lines mark 5km, and y is the number of runners. I think 1px is 30 runners or something. For the dot view, the y was just a random number. The dots were all very transparent so they looked different when they stacked up to some point, but 100 dots on top of each other looked no different than 1000 or 10000 dots that&#039;s why I scattered them a bit.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Jerome,

This is cool : ) Nice work.. 

My humble criticism:
- Your script is completely devouring my CPU. Great that I have 2 cores. 
- On first view, I didn&#039;t understand what X and Y axis stand for. It looks clean and simple now as it is, but I would have put tiny legend to explain.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One more thing: your first version might be an excellent test case for the improved performance of D3, so if you&#039;re ready for it and want to make the conversion to D3... that might be really interesting! :)]]></description>
