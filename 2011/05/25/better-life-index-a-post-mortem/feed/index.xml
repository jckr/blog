this is really key, and what keeps so many organisations already established in their field and well-regarded for their expertise from recognising the critical need for data visualisation, and more visual/smart/creative data manifestation in general. companies seem to think, they need to hire a designer to have great design, and if they don&#039;t want to budget for a great designer, there&#039;s no other way. we need a web tool connecting freelance designers and orgs that have a need for this work, so both profit in an economic and visually exciting manner.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jerome, thanks a lot for sharing this story with us. There is a desperate need for showing what happens behind the curtains of data visualization projects. I really enjoyed the read and I think it&#039;s a fantastic product. Bravo to all of you! To me it&#039;s a perfect example of graphical integrity and emotional design. This is how data visualization should always be.]]></description>

Just one question, it&#039;s planed an API or release the underlying software? It would be nice be able to apply this software to other visualizations.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jerome hello,

Of course, I already check the website yesterday : ) And it&#039;s nice to read behind-the-curtains process here. Great story! Thanks for sharing your insights. 

I completely agree with you on the lessons learned. I think this project will add even more momentum to the need for high-quality data-viz movement.

Congrats to you, Moritz Stefaner and the whole team.

Cheers..

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for reporting insight about the project development. It&#039;s really interesting the divide in data visualization between audience and knowing experts, and how design needs to bridge across both domains. This is sometimes difficult to achieve when there are so many parties involved in the process. I think the lessons you&#039;ve outlined are great building blocks for how organizations should approach designed data viz strategies that offer higher ROI than ones based on generic graphing or audience bamboozlement.]]></description>
