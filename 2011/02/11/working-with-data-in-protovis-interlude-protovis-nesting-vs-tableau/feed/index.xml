		<description><![CDATA[Great comparison Jerome. For me, this post highlights why I think Tableau is so successful. I am really excited by Protovis, and see some wonderful visualisations created with it. I particularly like Jan Willem Tulp&#039;s circular visualisations. Protovis is clearly one powerful tool. However, it&#039;s a programmer&#039;s tool. Even simple charts require some knowledge of programming. Instantly, you&#039;ve lost about 99% of all people who might be interested in vizualisation.

When I use Tableau, I am always amazed at how far you can get with just the mouse. For this reason, it&#039;s future is bright as it puts the power back in the hands of the non-programmers.]]></description>
