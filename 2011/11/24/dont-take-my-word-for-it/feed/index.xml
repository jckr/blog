		<description><![CDATA[No I didn&#039;t try to pitch it that way. It was done after the fact. My main goal was to inspire administrations to use such tools and I can&#039;t say I have been that successful in that respect. 

The pattern I see is that media would launch or propagate an assertion which attacks the current policies. Sometimes this is backed by a huge dataset and they can use datavis to make their point (Washington post has run a few such stories). But this is not always the case. For instance, media can simply cite a politician that makes an outlandish claim. 

With that in mind administration is just a sitting duck. They are not equipped to face such claims. However, if visualization is done &quot;preemptively&quot; to show that the policy choice that they make coincide with public interest, then such accusations can be defused. Other media, for instance, could easily point a contradiction. 

So, I&#039;m more interested in using visualizations to defend than to attack :)

I have shown this vis to various senior officials who all liked it but didn&#039;t think they could afford going in that direction in this economic context. We&#039;ll eventually get there because vis can have an enormous ROI. 

and if you read this and you are in a position to commission political visualizations do get in touch! I&#039;ll be happy to advise.]]></description>
